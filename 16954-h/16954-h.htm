<p>A soft rather shaky sort of tap at the door. It
does not all at once reach the rather deaf ears of
the little old lady and tall, still older gentleman
who are seated in their usual arm-chairs, one with
his newspaper by the window, the other with her
netting by the fire, in the exceedingly neat&mdash;neat,
indeed, is no word for it&mdash;"parlour" of Arbitt
Lodge. In what part of the country this queerly-named
house was&mdash;is still, perhaps&mdash;to be found
there is no particular reason for telling; whence
came this same queer name will be told in good
time. The parlour suited <i>its</i> name anyway better
far than it would that of "drawing-room," which
would be given it nowadays. There was a round
table in the middle; there were high-backed maho<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>gany
chairs against the wall, polished by age and
careful rubbing to that stage of dark shininess
which makes even mahogany pleasant to the eye,
and with seats of flowering silk damask whose
texture must have been <i>very</i> good to be so faded
without being worn; there were spindle-legged side-tables
holding inlaid "papier-mach&eacute;" desks and rose-wood
work-boxes, and two or three carved cedar or
sandal-wood cases of various shapes. And, most
tempting of all to my mind, there were glass-doored
cupboards in the wall, with great treasures of handleless
teacups and very fat teapots, not to speak of
bowls and jugs of every form and size; and everything,
from the Indian box with the ivory chessmen
to the china Turk with his long pipe of green spun-glass,
sitting cross-legged on the high mantelpiece
between a very sentimental lady and gentleman,
also of china, who occupied its two ends,&mdash;<i>everything</i>
was exactly and precisely in its own place, in what
had been its own place ever since the day, now
more than thirty years ago, when Grandpapa, the
tall old gentleman, had retired from the army on
half-pay and come to settle down at Arbitt Lodge
for the rest of his life with Grandmamma and their
son Marmaduke. A very small Marmaduke, for he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>was the only one left of a pretty flock who, one
after the other, had but hovered down into the
world for a year or two to spread their tiny wings
and take flight again, leaving two desolate hearts
behind them. And in this same parlour at Arbitt
Lodge had <i>that</i> little Marmaduke learned to walk,
and then to run, to gaze with admiring eyes on the
treasures in the glass cupboards, to play bo-peep
behind the thick silken curtains, even in <i>his</i> time
faded to a withered-leaf green, to poke his tiny nose
into the bowl of pot-pourri on the centre table,
which made him sneeze just exactly as&mdash;ah! but I
am forgetting&mdash;never mind, I may as well finish the
sentence&mdash;just exactly as it made "us" sneeze now!</p>

<p>After the tap came a kind of little pattering
and scratching, like baby taps, not quite sure of
their own existence; then, had Grandpapa's and
Grandmamma's ears been a very little sharper, they
could not but have heard a small duel in words.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, bruvver, my fingers' bones is tired."</p>

<p>"I <i>told</i> you, sister," reproachfully, "us should
always bring old Neddy's nose downstairs with us.
They never hear <i>us</i> tapping."</p>

<p>Then a faint sigh or two and a redoubled assault,
crowned with success. Grandmamma, whom after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>all I am not sure but that I have maligned in
calling her deaf&mdash;the taps were so very faint really!&mdash;Grandmamma
looks up from her netting, and in
a thin but clear voice calls out, "Come in!"</p>

<p>The door opens&mdash;then, after admitting the entrance
of two small figures, is carefully closed again,
and the two small figures, with a military salute from
the boy, a bob, conscientiously intended for a curtsey,
from the girl, advance a step or two into the room.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma," say the two high-pitched baby
voices, speaking so exactly together that they sound
but as one. "Grandmamma, it's '<i>us</i>.'"</p>

<p>Still no response. Grandmamma is not indifferent&mdash;far
from it&mdash;but just at this moment her
netting is at a critical stage impossible to disregard;
she <i>thinks</i> to herself "wait a moment, my dears,"
and is quite under the impression that she has said
it aloud; this is a mistake, but all the same "my
dears" do wait a moment&mdash;several moments indeed,
hand-in-hand, uncomplainingly, without indeed the
very faintest notion in their faithful little hearts that
there is anything to complain of&mdash;there are <i>some</i>
lessons to be learnt from children long ago, I think,&mdash;while
Grandmamma tries to secure her knots.</p>

<p>Look at them while they stand there; it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>always a good plan to save time, and we have a
minute or two to spare. They are so alike in size
and colour and feature that if it had not been that
one was a boy and the other a girl, there would
have been no telling them apart. Before Duke was
put into the first stage of boy-attire&mdash;what that
exactly was in those days I confess I am not sure&mdash;they
never <i>had</i> been told apart was the fact of the
matter, till one day the brilliant idea struck Grandmamma
of decorating little Pamela with a coral
necklace. She little knew what she was about;
both babies burst into howling distress, and were
not to be quieted even when the unlucky beads
were taken away; no, indeed, they only cried the
more. Grandmamma and Nurse were at their wits'
end, and Grandpapa's superior intelligence had at
last to be appealed to. And not in vain.</p>

<p>"They must <i>each</i> have one," said Grandpapa
solemnly. And so it had to be. In consequence
of which fine sense of justice and firm determination
on the part of the babies, they went on "not being
told apart" till, as I said, the day came when
Marmaduke's attire began to be cut after a different
fashion, and by degrees he arrived at his present
dignity of nankin suits complete. Such funny suits
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>you would think them now&mdash;funnier even than
Pamela's white frock, with its skirt to the ankles
and blue-sashed waist up close under the arm-pits,
for even if she walked in just as I describe her you
would only call her "a Kate-Greenway-dressed little
girl." But Marmaduke's light yellow trousers,
buttoning up <i>over</i> his waistcoat, with bright brass
buttons, and open yellow jacket to match, would look
odd. Especially on such a very little boy&mdash;for he
and Pamela, as they stand there with their flaxen
hair falling over their shoulders and their very blue
eyes gazing solemnly before them, wondering when
either of the old people will think fit to speak to
"us"&mdash;Pamela and he are only "six last birfday."</p>

<p>All this time Grandpapa is in happy&mdash;no, I won't
say "happy," for the old gentleman is always, to give
him his due, pleased to welcome the children to his
presence, "at the right time and in the right manner,"
be it understood&mdash;in <i>complete</i> unconsciousness of
their near neighbourhood. There was nothing to
reveal it; they had not left the door open so as to
cause a draught, for Grandpapa abhorred draughts;
they were as still and quiet as two little mice, when
mice <i>are</i> quiet that is to say. For often in the
middle of the night, when my sleep has been dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>turbed
by these same little animals who have been
held up as a model for never disturbing any one, I
have wondered how they gained this distinction!
"When mouses is quiet, perhaps it's cos they isn't
there," said a little boy I know, and the remark
seems to me worthy of deep consideration.</p>

<p>Grandpapa was absorbed in his newspaper, for
it was newspaper day for <i>him</i>, and newspaper day
only came once a week, and when it&mdash;the paper,
not the day&mdash;did come, it was already the best part
of a week old. For it came all the way from London,
and that not by the post, as we understand the word,
but by the post of those days, which meant "his
Majesty's mail," literally speaking, and his Majesty's
mail took a very long time indeed to reach outlying
parts of the country, for all the brave appearance,
horses foaming, whips cracking, and flourishing of
horns, not to say trumpets, with which it clattered
over the stones of the "High Streets" of those days.
And the paper&mdash;poor two-leaved, miserable little
pretence that <i>we</i> should think it&mdash;cost both for itself
and for its journey from London, oh so dear! I am
afraid to say how much, for I should be sorry to
exaggerate. But "those days" are receding ever
farther and farther from us, and as I write it comes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>over me sadly that it is no use <i>now</i> to leave a blank
on my page and say to myself, "I will ask dear such
a one, or such an other. He or she will remember,
and I will fill it in afterwards." For those dear
ones of the last generation are passing from us&mdash;have
already passed from us in such numbers that
we who were young not so very long ago shall ere
long find ourselves in their places. So I would
rather not say what Grandpapa's newspaper cost, but
certainly it was dear enough and rare enough for
him to think of little else the day it came; and I
don't suppose he would have noticed the two children
at all, till Grandmamma had made him do so, had
it not been that just as they were beginning to be
a <i>little</i> tired, to whisper to each other, "Suppose us
stands on other legs for a change," something&mdash;I
don't know what&mdash;for his snuff-box had been lying
peacefully in his waistcoat pocket ever since Dymock,
his old soldier-servant, had brought in the newspaper&mdash;made
him sneeze. And with the sneeze he
left off looking at the paper and raised his eyes,
and his eyes being very good ones for his age&mdash;much
better in comparison than his ears&mdash;he quickly
caught sight of his grandchildren.</p>

<p>"So ho!" he exclaimed, "and <i>you</i> are there,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>master and missy! I did not know it was already
so late. Grave news, my love," he added, turning
to Grandmamma; "looks like war again. The world
is trying to go too fast," he went on, turning to his
paper. "They are actually speaking of running a
new mail-coach from London which should reach
Sandlingham in three days. It is appalling,&mdash;why,
I remember when I was young it took&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is flying in the face of Providence, <i>I</i> should
say, my dear," interrupted Grandmamma.</p>

<p>The two little faces near the door grew still
more solemn. What strange words big people used!&mdash;what
could Grandpapa and Grandmamma mean?
But Grandpapa laid down his paper and looked at
them again; Grandmamma too by this time was less
embarrassed by her work. The children felt that
they had at last attracted the old people's attention.</p>

<p>"We came, Grandpapa and Grandmamma, to
wish you good-night," began Duke.</p>

<p>"And to hope you will bo'f sleep very well,"
added Pamela.</p>

<p>This little formula was repeated every evening
with the same ceremony.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my good children," said Grandpapa
encouragingly; on which the little couple approached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>and stood one on each side of him, while he patted
the flaxen heads.</p>

<p>"I may call you 'my good children' to-night, I
hope?" he said inquiringly.</p>

<p>The two looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Bruvver has been good, sir," said the little girl.</p>

<p>"Sister has been good, sir," said the little boy.</p>

<p>The two heads were patted again approvingly.</p>

<p>"But us haven't <i>bo'f</i> been good," added the two
voices together.</p>

<p>Grandpapa looked very serious.</p>

<p>"Indeed, how can that be?" he said.</p>

<p>There was a pause of consideration. Then a
bright idea struck little Marmaduke.</p>

<p>"I think perhaps it was <i>most</i> Toby," he said.
"Us was running, and Toby too, and us felled down,
and Toby barked, and when us got up again it was
all tored."</p>

<p>"What?" said Grandpapa, still very grave.</p>

<p>"Sister's gown, sir."</p>

<p>"My clean white gown," added Pamela impressively;
"but bruvver didn't do it. <i>He</i> said so."</p>

<p>"And sister didn't do it. <i>She</i> said so," stated
Duke. "But Nurse said <i>one</i> of us had done it.
Only I don't think she had thought of Toby."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Grandpapa. "Let us hope it
was Toby."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Grandmamma, who had
quite disengaged herself from her netting by this
time, "Pamela must remember that she is growing
a big missy, and it does not become big misses to
run about so as to tear their gowns."</p>

<p>Pamela listened respectfully, but Grandmamma's
tone was not alarming. The little girl slowly edged
her way along from Grandpapa's chair to Grandmamma's.</p>

<p>"Did you never tear your gowns when you were
a little missy, Grandmamma?" she inquired, looking
up solemnly into the old lady's face. Grandmamma
smiled, and looked across at her husband rather
slily. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Who would think it indeed?" he said, smiling
in turn. "Listen, my little girl, but be sure you
tell it again to no one, for it was a little bird told
it to me, and little birds are not fond of having
their secrets repeated. Once upon a time there was
not a greater hoyden in all the countryside than
your Grandmamma there. She swam the brooks,
she climbed the trees, she tore her gowns&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Till at last my poor mother told the pedlar the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>next time he came round he must bring her a web
of some stuff that <i>wouldn't</i> tear to dress me in,"
said Grandmamma; "and to this day I mind me as
if it had been but last week of the cloth he brought.
Sure enough it would neither tear nor wear, and oh
how ugly it was! 'Birstle peas' colour they called
it, and how ashamed I was of the time I had to
wear it. 'Little miss in her birstle-peas gown'
was a byword in the countryside. No, my Pamela,
I should be sorry to have to dress you in such a
gown."</p>

<p>"I'll try not to tear my nice white gowns," said
the little girl; "Nurse said she would mend it, but
it would take her a long time. Grandmamma," she
went on, suddenly changing the subject, "what does
a 'charge' mean, 'a great charge?'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marmaduke, who heard what she
said, "'a <i>very</i> great charge.'"</p>

<p>Grandpapa's eyes grew brighter.</p>

<p>"Can they be speaking of a field of battle?" he
said quickly. But Duke turned his large wistful
blue eyes on him before Grandmamma had time to
answer.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said, in his slow earnest way, "it
wasn't about battles; it was about <i>us</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"She said <i>us</i> was that thing," added Pamela.</p>

<p>"Who said so?" inquired Grandmamma, and her
voice was perhaps a little, a very little, sharp.</p>

<p>"Nurse said it," said Pamela. "It was when us
had felled down, and the old woman was at the
door of her house, and she asked if us was hurt, and
Nurse was vexed, and then she said that."</p>

<p>"What old woman?" asked Grandmamma again.</p>

<p>"Her that makes the cakes," said Duke.</p>

<p>"Oh, Barbara Twiss!" said the old lady in a tone
of relief. "Now, my dear children, kiss Grandpapa
and kiss me, and say good-night. I will explain to
you when you are bigger what Nurse meant. God
bless you and give you a nice sleep till to-morrow
morning!"</p>

<p>The two little creatures obeyed at once. No
"oh, <i>mayn't</i> we stay ten minutes"'s, "just <i>five</i>
minutes then, oh please"'s&mdash;so coaxingly urged, so
hard to refuse&mdash;of the little ones of our day! No,
Marmaduke and Pamela said their "good-nights" in
dutiful fashion, stopping a moment at the door
before leaving the room, there to execute the
military salute and the miniature curtsey, and went
off to bed, their curiosity still unsatisfied, as
children's curiosity often had to remain in those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>times when "wait till you are big and then you
will be told" was the regular reply to questions it
was not easy or desirable to answer otherwise.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence when they had left
the room. Grandpapa's face was once more hidden
in his newspaper; Grandmamma had taken up her
netting again, but it did not go on very vigorously.</p>

<p>"I must warn Nurse," she said at last. "She
means no harm, but she must be careful what she
says before the children. She forgets how big they
are growing, and how they notice all they hear."</p>

<p>"It was no great harm, after all," said Grandpapa,
more than half, to tell the truth, immersed in
his paper.</p>

<p>"Not as said to a discreet person like Barbara,"
replied Grandmamma. "But still&mdash;they have the
right to all we can give them, the little dears, as
long as we are here to give it. I could not bear
them ever to have the idea that we felt them a
burden."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," agreed Grandpapa, looking up
for a moment. "A <i>burden</i> they can never be; still
it is a great responsibility&mdash;a great charge, in one
sense, as Nurse said&mdash;to have in our old age. For,
do the best we can, my love, we cannot be to them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>what their parents would have been. Nor can we
hope to be with them till we can see them able to
take care of themselves."</p>

<p>"There is no knowing," said Grandmamma. "God
is good. He may spare us yet some years for the
little ones' sakes. And it is a mercy to think they
have each other. It is always 'us' with them&mdash;never
'me.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandpapa, "they love each other
dearly;" and as if that settled all the difficulties
the future might bring, he disappeared finally into
the newspaper.</p>

<p>Grandmamma, for her part, <i>meant</i> to disappear
into her netting. But somehow it did not go on
as briskly as usual. Her hands seemed to lag, and
more than once she was startled by a tear rolling
quickly down her thin soft old cheek&mdash;one of the
slow-coming, touching tears of old age. She would
have been sorry for Grandpapa to see that she was
crying; she was always cheerful with him. But of
that there was no fear. So Grandmamma sat and
cried a little quietly to herself, for the children's
innocent words had roused some sad thoughts, and
brought before her some pictures of happy pasts and
happy "might-have-beens."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is strange," she thought to herself, "very
strange to think of&mdash;that we two, old and tired and
ready to rest, should be here left behind by them
all. All my pretty little ones, who might almost,
some of them, have been grandparents themselves
by this time! Left behind to take care of Duke's
babies&mdash;ah, my brave boy, that was the hardest
blow of all! The others were too delicate and
fragile for this world&mdash;I learnt not to murmur at
their so quickly taking flight. But he&mdash;so strong
and full of life&mdash;who had come through all the
dangers of babyhood and childhood, who had grown
up so good and manly, so fit to do useful work in
the world&mdash;was there no other victim for the deadly
cholera's clutch, out there in the burning East?" and
Grandmamma shuddered as a vision of the terrible
scenes of a plague-stricken land, that she had more
than once seen for herself, passed before her. "We
had little cause to rejoice in the times of peace
when they came. It would have seemed less
terrible for him to be killed on the battlefield.
Still&mdash;it was on the battlefield of duty. My
boy, my own good boy! No wonder she could
not live without him&mdash;poor, gentle little Lavinia,
almost a child herself. Though if she had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>but a little stronger,&mdash;if she could but have breasted
the storm of sorrow till her youth came back
again to her a little in the pleasure of watching
these dear babies improving as they did,&mdash;she
might have been a great comfort to us, and she
would have found work to do which would have
kept her from over-grieving. Poor Lavinia! How
well I remember the evening they arrived&mdash;she
and the two poor yellow shrivelled-up looking little
creatures. I remember, sad at heart as we were&mdash;only
two months after the bitter news of my boy's
death!&mdash;Nurse and I could almost have found it in
our hearts to laugh when the ayah unwrapped them
for us to see. They were so like two miserable
little unfledged birds! And poor Lavinia so proud
of them, through her tears&mdash;what did she know of
babies, poor dear?&mdash;and looking so anxiously to see
what we thought of them. I <i>could</i> not say they
were pretty&mdash;Duke's children though they were."
And a queer little sound&mdash;half laugh, half sob&mdash;escaped
from Grandmamma at the recollection.
But it did not matter&mdash;Grandpapa was too deaf to
hear. So she dried her eyes again quietly with her
fine lavender-scented cambric pocket-handkerchief,
and went on with her recollections all to herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
She seemed to see the two tiny creatures gradually&mdash;very
gradually&mdash;growing plump and rosy in the
sweet fresh English air, the look of unnatural old
age that one sometimes sees in very delicate babies
by degrees fading away as the thin little faces grew
round and even dimpled; then came the recollection
of the first toddling walk, when the two kept
tumbling against each other, so that even the sad-eyed
young widow could not help laughing; the
first lisping words, which, alas, might not be the
sweet baby names for father or mother&mdash;for by
that time poor Lavinia had faded out of life, with
words of whispered love and thankfulness to the
grandparents so willing to do their utmost. But it
was a sad little story at best, and even Grandmamma's
brave old heart trembled when she thought
that it might come to be sadder still.</p>

<p>"What would become of them if they were left
<i>quite</i> alone in the world," she could not help saying
to herself. "And though I am not so old as my
dear husband by ten years, I cannot picture myself
finding strength to live without him, nor would a
poor old woman like me be much good to the
young creatures if I did! But one must not lose
courage, nor grieve about troubles before they come.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
For, after all, who would ever have believed these
two poor fledglings would grow up to be two bonnie
bairnies like Marmaduke and Pamela now!"</p>

<p>And for the last time that evening Grandmamma
again wiped her eyes&mdash;though these tears were of
thankfulness and motherly pride in the thought of
the sweet and pretty children upstairs, who at that
moment were kneeling in their little white nightgowns,
one on each side of old Nurse, as they solemnly
repeated after her the Lord's Prayer, and after that
their own evening petitions that "God would bless
dear Grandpapa and Grandmamma, and make 'us'
very good children, and a comfort to them in their
old age."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandmamma would probably have spoken to Nurse
the next day about being careful as to what she said
before the children, had not the next day brought
rather a commotion. Nurse was ill, which, old as
she, too, was, rarely happened. It was a bad attack
of rheumatism, and very likely its coming on had
made her less patient than usual the day before.
However that may have been, Grandmamma was
far too sorry to see her suffering to say anything
which might have troubled her, for she was already
distressed enough at not being able to get up and
go about as usual.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Nurse," said the children to console
her, when a message had been brought from Grandmamma
in the morning to say that Nurse was on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>no account to try to get up till the doctor had seen
her, "us is going to be very good. Us can do all
your work, and you can stay in bed till your legs
is not cracked any more," for they had heard her
complaining of her knees and ankles being "wracked"
with pain.</p>

<p>On the whole I am afraid Duke and Pamela did
not think Nurse's rheumatism altogether an "ill-wind,"
as they sat on their high chairs at breakfast
at the nursery table.</p>

<p>"Shall you eat all yours up, bruvver?" asked
Pamela, pointing to the bowl of bread and milk
which Duke was discussing.</p>

<p>"Shall you?" asked Duke warily, before committing
himself.</p>

<p>Pamela looked contemplatively at her bowl.</p>

<p>"I think I'll leave just a very little," she said.
"Cook won't see. I wish the bowls wasn't <i>quite</i>
so big."</p>

<p>"<i>Cook</i> wouldn't see if us left a great deal," said
Duke insinuatingly, but Pamela looked shocked.</p>

<p>"That would be very naughty," she said. "<i>If</i>
you leave a great deal, Duke, I'll have to put it in
the cupboard myself."</p>

<p>Upon which mysterious hint Duke set to work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>valiantly. But he had a small appetite, and so
had Pamela. It was almost the only remains of
their having been such delicate little children, and
perhaps if they had been <i>too</i> much given in to
about eating, they would have ended by eating
almost nothing at all, and being much less strong
and well than they were. Nurse, who had come to
them from a family of great strong boys and girls at
a country rectory, had no patience with "fads and
fancies;" and as, on the whole, the children had
prospered wonderfully under her care and she was
really good to them, Grandmamma did not often
interfere, nor did it ever occur to them to complain,
even though nowadays children would, I think, find
some of old Nurse's rules very much to be complained
of indeed. Of these one was, that if the
children did not finish the bowl of bread and milk
at breakfast it was put away in the nursery cupboard
and had to be eaten, cold and uninviting-looking as it
had then become, before anything else at dinner-time.
This was a sore trouble to the little brother
and sister, more especially as if they did not finish
the bread and milk they could not expect to have
the treat waiting for them downstairs in the dining-room
at Grandpapa's and Grandmamma's breakfast&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>of
a cup of weak but sweet tea and a tiny slice
of bread and butter or toast, with sometimes the
tops of the old people's eggs, and at others a taste of
honey, or marmalade, or strawberry jam, all daintily
set out by Grandmamma's own little white hands!</p>

<p>So for every reason Duke and Pamela wished to
eat up the bread and milk to the last spoonful.
It was not that they did not like it&mdash;it was as
good and nice as bread and milk could be, and they
were not dainty. Only they could not eat so much!
This morning they had not half finished when
their appetites began to flag. Perhaps it was with
the excitement of Nurse being absent&mdash;perhaps they
chattered and "played" over their breakfast, not
having her to keep them up to the mark&mdash;I can't
say. But the bowls were still deplorably full,
though the milk was no longer steaming, and the
little squares of bread had lost their neat shape,
and were all "squashy" together, when Duke threw
down his spoon in despair.</p>

<p>"I can't eat any more, sister. I cannot try any
more."</p>

<p>Pamela opened her lips to make some reproach;
she was a very "proper" little girl, as you have
probably discovered, but the words died away before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>they were uttered, as her eyes fell on her own bowl,
and with a deep sigh she said:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't finish mine either. And
after us saying to Nurse about going to be so good."</p>

<p>Her blue eyes began to look very dewy. Duke,
who could not bear to see his dear "sister" sad,
spoke out (in Nurse's absence be it observed)
valiantly&mdash;more so, it must be confessed, than was
his wont.</p>

<p>"I don't see that it's naughty of us not to eat
more when us isn't hungry for more. <i>I</i> think it
would be like little pigs to eat more than they
want. Little pigs would go on eating all day just
'cos they're too silly, and they've got nothing else
to do."</p>

<p>"But," objected Pamela, "us haven't eaten as
much as us <i>can</i>, Duke, for you know downstairs us
<i>could</i> eat Grandmamma's treat. <i>I</i> could&mdash;I could
snap it up in a minute, and the tea too, and yet I
<i>can't</i> eat any more bread and milk!" and she gazed
at the bowl with a puzzled as well as doleful expression.
"I'm afraid&mdash;yes, I'm afraid, Duke,
that us is dainty like Master Frederick and Miss
Lucy in 'Amusing Tales.' And Nurse says it is
so very naughty to be dainty when so many poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>children would fink our bread and milk such a great
treat."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I wish, then, they'd come and eat it,"
said Duke. "I'd be very glad to give it them."</p>

<p>His boldness quite took away his sister's breath,
and she looked up at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"<i>Bruvver!</i>" she said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothing naughty in that. It
would be much better than letting it all be wasted.
And&mdash;&mdash;" but just at that moment came a queer
little sound at the door, which made Duke tumble
off his high chair as fast as he could, and hurry to
open it.</p>

<p>"It's Toby," he cried.</p>

<p>Toby, sure enough, it was&mdash;Toby with his little
black nose and bright eyes gleaming from behind
the overhanging shaggy hair, that no one <i>but</i> a
Toby could have seen through without squinting&mdash;Toby,
rather subdued and meekly inquiring at first,
as if not quite sure of his welcome, till&mdash;a glance
round the room satisfying him that there was no
one to dread, no one but his two dearly-beloved
friends&mdash;his courage returned, and he rushed towards
them with short yelps of delight, twisting
about his furry little body, and wagging his queer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>short feathery tail, till one could not tell what was
what of him, and almost expected to see him shake
himself into bits!</p>

<p>"Toby, dear Toby!" cried the children, all their
perplexities forgotten for the moment. "<i>How</i>
clever of him&mdash;isn't it?&mdash;to come to see us this
morning, just as if he knew us was alone. Dear
Toby&mdash;but hush! don't make a noise, Toby, or
Nurse may be vexed&mdash;are you so pleased to see
us, Toby?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Duke separated himself from the group
of three all rolling in a heap on the floor together
and made for the table, and before Pamela could
see what he was doing he was back again&mdash;his bowl,
into which he had poured the contents of his sister's
as well, in his hand, and in another moment Toby's
nose was in the bowl too, to Toby's supreme content!
It was done now&mdash;there was no stopping
him till <i>he</i> had done. Aghast, and yet filled with
admiration, Pamela could only express her feelings
by the one word&mdash;"Bruvver!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it a good thought?" said Duke. "Why,
he'll have finished it all in a minute, and nobody
will ever know that it wasn't us. And nothing will
have been wasted. There now," as Toby, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>really made wonderfully quick work, lifted from the
now empty bowl his hairy muzzle bespattered with
remains of bread and milk, which he proceeded to
lick away with his sharp bright-red tongue, with an
air of the greatest satisfaction.</p>

<p>For a moment or two Pamela's face expressed
nothing but approval. But gradually a little cloud
stole over it.</p>

<p>"What shall us say if Grandpapa and Grandmamma
ask if us have eaten all our bread and
milk?" she said.</p>

<p>Duke considered.</p>

<p>"Us can say the bowls are quite empty. <i>That</i>
won't be a story," and Pamela's face cleared again.
Just then she had no time for second thoughts, for
the sound of a bell ringing downstairs made both
children start.</p>

<p>"Prayers," they exclaimed, and as they said the
word a young housemaid put her face in at the
door.</p>

<p>"Master Duke and Miss Pamela," she said,
"Nurse says I'm to take you down to prayers. But
you must come first to wash your hands and smooth
your hair."</p>

<p>A very correct little couple presented themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>a few minutes later at the dining-room door, and
after the salute and the curtsey, and wishing Grandpapa
and Grandmamma "a very good morning,"
seated themselves one on each side of the old lady,
while Grandpapa read from the prayer-book a few
verses of the Bible, the Collect of last Sunday, and
two or three prayers for the benefit of the whole
family, including a row of neat, mostly elderly,
servants near the door. Duke and Pamela listened
attentively, their hands crossed on their knees, their
eyes fixed on Grandpapa&mdash;no fidgetting or staring
about or making signs to each other. Such things
would probably have been severely punished.</p>

<p>And then came what was almost the happiest
part of the day for "us,"&mdash;breakfast number two;
that is, breakfast with Grandpapa and Grandmamma.
With the greatest interest they watched to see what
was to be given them. This morning there were no
eggs, but there were some tempting little slices of
toast, fresh butter, and a glass dish of honey, clear
as amber, with which materials Grandmamma proceeded
to fabricate two delicious sandwiches, having
already filled the little cups with weak, but, this
morning, sugarless tea.</p>

<p>"No need to put sugar when you are eating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>honey. You would not taste it," she explained.
"Now, then, is not that a nice little treat for my
two good children?" and Duke and Pamela were
eagerly drawing in their chairs when another question
from Grandmamma suddenly reminded them of
what they had for the time forgotten. "You ate
your breakfast nicely upstairs, I hope? Did you
finish all the bread and milk?"</p>

<p>Brother looked at sister and sister looked at
brother. Both grew rosier than usual, but Grandmamma,
though fairly quick of hearing, was somewhat
near-sighted. Pamela touched Duke without
the old lady seeing, and <i>looked</i> what he understood&mdash;"Let
us tell, Duke." But Duke would not
allow himself to think he did understand. The tea
and the honey sandwiches were so tempting!</p>

<p>"The bowls were quite empty, Grandmamma,"
he said. And Grandmamma, who had wondered a
little at their hesitation in answering, seemed
relieved. For, kind as she was, "rules were rules,"
to Grandmamma's thinking; and, though it would
have pained her more than the children, she would
certainly have thought it right to send them upstairs
treatless had the answer been different.</p>

<p>"That is well," she said cheerfully, and then the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>two climbed on to their chairs and drew their cups
and plates close to them; while Grandmamma went
round to her own end of the table, where&mdash;for she was
a very tiny little old lady&mdash;she was almost hidden
from view by the large silver tea-urn. She went
on talking to Grandpapa, and the children set to
work at what was before them. They were quite
silent; not that they ever thought of really speaking,
except when "spoken to," at their grandparents'
table, but no little whispers or smiles passed between
themselves as usual; they ate on solemnly, and
<i>somehow</i>&mdash;how was it?&mdash;the honey sandwiches did
not taste quite as delicious as they had expected.
But though each had the same sort of disappointed
feeling, neither said anything about it to the other.</p>

<p>After breakfast Grandpapa went off to his study,
and Grandmamma rang the bell for Dymock, who
carried away the big tea-urn, the silver hot-water
dish in which was served Grandpapa's rasher of
bacon, the knives and forks,&mdash;everything, in short,
on the table except the cups and saucers and the
rest of the china belonging to the breakfast-service.
This china was very curious, and, to those who understood
such things, very beautiful. Grandpapa had
got it in his travels at some out-of-the-way place,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>and the story went that it had been made for some
great Chinese lady&mdash;some "mandarin-ess," Grandmamma
used to say in laughing, who had never
allowed it to be copied. How it had been got from <i>her</i>
I cannot say. It was very fine in quality, and it was
painted all over with green dragons, with gilt tongues
and eyes, and the edges of the cups and saucers
were also gilt. There were large as well as small
cups; the large ones, of course, were for breakfast,
and the small ones for tea, but Grandmamma always
kept out two of the latter for Duke and Pamela.
In those days one never saw large cups of oriental
china, and this was what made the service particularly
uncommon, and Grandpapa had never been
able to find out if the large ones were really
Chinese or only imitation, copied from the smaller
ones. If really Chinese, then the lady-mandarin
was most likely an Englishwoman after all, who
had had them specially made for her.</p>

<p>You will be surprised to hear that during the
thirty or forty years during which Grandpapa and
Grandmamma had daily used this precious china
not a single piece had been broken, scarcely even
chipped, though, by force of simple usage, the green
dragons had grown less brilliant, and here and there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>the golden tongues and eyes had altogether disappeared,
while the whole had grown soft and mellowed,
so that a moment's glance was enough to
show it was really <i>old</i> porcelain. And perhaps you
will be still more surprised to learn how it was
that these happy cups and saucers had escaped the
usual fate of their kind. It was because Grandmamma
always washed them up herself! I think
there was no part of the day more pleasant to "us"
than when&mdash;Dymock having cleared away all that
was his charge, and brought all that Grandmamma
required from the pantry&mdash;the old lady established
herself at one end of the table, with two bowls of
beautifully white wood, and a jug of hot water
before her, and a towel of fine damask in her hand,
and set to work daintily to rinse out each cup and
saucer in the first bowl, passing them then into the
fresh water of the second, and wiping them&mdash;after
they had stood to drip for a moment or two on a
small slab of wood made for the purpose&mdash;most
carefully with the little cloth. It was nice to watch
her&mdash;her hands looked so white, and moved so
nimbly, and&mdash;I had forgotten to mention that&mdash;looked
so business-like with the brown holland cuffs
braided in white which she kept for this occasion,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>and always put on, with the big holland apron to
match, before she began operations. Yes, it had
been a treat to "us" merely to watch her, and so
you can fancy how very proud Duke and Pamela
felt when she at length allowed them, each with a
little towel, to wipe their own cups and saucers.
They had been promoted to this for some months
now, and no accident had happened; and on those
days&mdash;few and far between, it must be allowed&mdash;on
which they had not been found deserving of their
breakfast number two, I think the punishment of
not "helping Grandmamma to wash up" had been
quite as great as that of missing the treat itself.
For very often, while deftly getting through her
task, Grandmamma would talk so nicely to the
children, telling them stories of the time when she
was a little girl herself, and of all the changes
between those far-away days and "now"; of the
strange, wonderful places she had visited with
Grandpapa; of cities with mosques and minarets
gleaming against the intense blue sky of the East
in the too splendid, scorching sunshine that no one
who has not seen it can picture to himself; of rides&mdash;weary
endless rides&mdash;night after night through the
desert; or voyages of months and months together
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>across the pathless ocean. They would sit, the
little brother and sister, staring up at her with their
great solemn blue eyes, as if they would never tire
of listening&mdash;how wonderfully wise Grandpapa and
Grandmamma must be!&mdash;"Surely," said little Pamela
one day with a great sigh, "surely Grandmamma
must know <i>everyfing</i>;" while Duke's breast swelled
with the thought that he too, like his father and
grandfather before him, would journey some day to
those distant lands, there, if need were, like them
"to fight for the king." For there were times at
which "bruvver" was quite determined to be a
soldier, though at others&mdash;the afternoon, for instance,
when the young bull poked his head through the
hedge and shook it at him and Pamela, and Duke's
toy-sword had unfortunately been left at home in
the nursery&mdash;he did not feel quite so sure about it!</p>

<p>But on this particular morning the little pair
were less interested and talkative than usual. They
sat so quiet while Grandmamma made her arrangements
that her attention was aroused.</p>

<p>"You are very silent little mice, this morning,"
she said. "Is it because poor Nurse is ill that
you seem in such low spirits?"</p>

<p>Duke and Pamela looked at each other. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>would have been so easy to say "yes," and Grandmamma
would have thought them so kind-hearted
and sympathising! Once one has swerved a little
bit from the straight exact road and begun to go
down-hill even in the least, it is so tempting to go
on a little farther&mdash;so much less difficult than to
stop short, or, still more, to try to go back again.
But these children were so unused to say anything
not quite true that they hesitated, and this hesitation
saved them from making another step in the
wrong direction.</p>

<p>"I wasn't finking of Nurse, Grandmamma," said
Pamela at last in rather a low voice.</p>

<p>"Nor I wasn't neither," said Duke, taking courage
by her example.</p>

<p>"That's all right, then," said Grandmamma cheerfully,
not having noticed anything unusual in their
tone. "Poor Nurse, we are sorry for her to be ill,
but I don't think it will be anything very bad.
And I am sure you will try to be <i>very</i> good."</p>

<p>"Yes, Grandmamma," said the two voices together,
but less confidently and more timidly than usual.
This time their tone caught the old lady's
attention.</p>

<p>"There's something on their minds," she said to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>herself. But she was a wise old lady, and thought
it better to wait a while before trying to find out
what it was.</p>

<p>"When I was a little girl," she began&mdash;and the
children pricked up their ears&mdash;"when I was a little
girl I remember once that our nurse was ill, or she
had to go away to see some friend who was ill, and,
as I was the eldest of several little brothers and
sisters, I had to help to take care of them. I had
always thought it would be very pleasant to be
without a nurse, though we liked ours very well,
and to be able to do just as we wished. But I
shall never forget how pleased I was to see her
come back again," and Grandmamma laughed a little
at the recollection.</p>

<p>"Why were you so pleased, Grandmamma?"
asked Pamela. "Had you done anyfing naughty?"</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> wouldn't have made Grandmamma pleased
for her nurse to come back," said Duke; and a
sudden thought of how "us" would have felt had
Nurse come into the room just as Toby was licking
up the last of the bread and milk made his face
grow rosy.</p>

<p>"We had not meant to be naughty," said Grandmamma,
"but we were not fit to manage for our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>selves.
Each of us wanted to do a different way,
and we were like a flock of poor little sheep without
a shepherd. You do not know, children, what a
comfort it is to have rules one must obey."</p>

<p>"But big people don't have to obey," said Duke.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, they have; and when they try to think
they have not, then it is that everything goes wrong
with them;" and seeing by the look in the two
little faces that they were still puzzled&mdash;"People
have to <i>obey</i> all their lives if they want to be happy,"
she went on. "Long after they have no more
nurses or fathers and mothers&mdash;or grandpapas and
grandmammas," with a little smile, which somehow
made the corners of Duke's and Pamela's mouths
go down. "The use of all those when we are
young is only to teach us what obeying means&mdash;to
teach us to listen to the voice we should <i>always</i>
obey&mdash;&mdash;" and Grandmamma stopped a minute and
looked at "us."</p>

<p>"God," said the two very solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes; but God speaks to us in different ways,
and we have to learn to know His voice. And the
way of all in which we <i>most</i> need to know it is
when it speaks to us in our own hearts&mdash;in ourselves.
It would be a very poor sort of being good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>or obeying if it was only so long as somebody else
was beside us telling us what to do and looking to
see that we did it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the two little voices together, lower
and still more solemn.</p>

<p>"As, for instance, this morning if, just because
Nurse was not with you, you had done anything you
would not have done had she been there," said Grandmamma,
looking keenly at the two flushed faces.</p>

<p>Another&mdash;"Yes, Grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Or," went on the old lady, speaking more
slowly, "a worse kind of disobeying&mdash;the telling
what is not really true; lots of people, big as well
as little, do that, and sometimes they try to make
<i>themselves</i> think, by all sorts of twistings and turnings,
that they have not done so when their own
hearts know they <i>have</i>. For the voice inside us is
<i>very</i> hard to silence or deceive&mdash;I think sometimes
indeed it <i>never</i> is silenced, but that our ears grow
deaf to it&mdash;that we make them so. But this is very
grave talk for you, my dear children&mdash;too grave and
difficult perhaps. I am getting so old that I suppose
I sometimes forget how very young you are!
And here come your own little cups and saucers,
nicely rinsed out, and waiting to be wiped dry."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Grandmamma," said Duke.</p>

<p>"Fank you, Grandmamma," said Pamela.</p>

<p>And the two small pairs of hands set to work
carefully at their daily task. But they did not
speak or ask Grandmamma any questions, and somehow
the old lady felt a little uneasy, for, even
though they were on the whole quiet children, this
morning there was a sort of constraint about them
which she did not understand. And they, on their
side, felt glad when the "washing-up" was over
and Grandmamma sent them upstairs to their
nursery, where they had lessons every morning for
two hours with a young girl whose mother had a
sort of dame school in the village.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Mitten, the young governess, had not yet
come when the children got to the nursery, though
all was in order for her&mdash;the table cleared, the
three chairs set round it ready. There was nothing
to do but to get out the books and slates. Duke
went to the window and stood there staring out
silently; Pamela, who always liked to be busy,
dragged forward a chair, meaning to climb on to
it so as to reach up to the high shelf where the
lesson things were kept. But, as she drew out the
chair, something that had been hidden from view in
a corner near which stood a small side-table caught
her eye. She let go the chair, stooping down to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>examine this something, and in a moment a cry
escaped her.</p>

<p>"Bruvver! oh, bruvver," she exclaimed, "just
see! How can it have got brokened?" and she
held up the bowl&mdash;or what had been the bowl
rather&mdash;out of which Toby had gobbled up his
unexpected breakfast,&mdash;broken, hopelessly broken,
into several pieces!</p>

<p>In an instant Duke was beside her, and together
they set to work to examine the damage, as if, alas!
any examining could have made it better. It was
far past mending, for, besides the two or three large
pieces Pamela had seized, there lay on the ground
a mass of smaller fragments, down to mere crumbs
of china.</p>

<p>"<i>Toby</i> couldn't have done it, could he?" said
Pamela. "He stayed in here when us went down
to prayers."</p>

<p>"No, oh no! <i>Toby</i> couldn't have broken it," said
Duke; "and even if he had, it would not have been
his fault. He didn't put it down on the floor. It
was near here he ate the bread and milk up&mdash;perhaps
he rolled the bowl behind the table."</p>

<p>"And Biddy pushed the table against it when
she was taking away the things. Yes, that must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>have been it," said Pamela. "Biddy couldn't have
noticed there was only one bowl on the tray."</p>

<p>"Anyway she didn't look for it," said Duke.
"She is very careless; Nurse often says so."</p>

<p>"But us can't put the blame on her," said
Pamela. "Us <i>must</i> tell, Duke."</p>

<p>Duke had the pieces of china in his hand, and
was carefully considering them.</p>

<p>"Will Grandmamma be vexed, do you think,
sister?"</p>

<p>"Grandmamma doesn't like things being brokened,"
said Pamela. "And Nurse said one day
these bowls was very good china."</p>

<p>"And Grandmamma will ask all about how it
was broken," added Duke dolefully; "and then
us'll have to tell about giving Toby our bread
and milk, and oh, sister, I said the bowls was
<i>quite</i> empty, to make her think <i>us</i> had emptied
them!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Grandmamma will fink us is <i>very</i>
naughty," agreed Pamela; "she'll fink us don't listen
to that&mdash;that speaking inside us that she was telling
us about,&mdash;for it's quite true, bruvver; I felt it was
quite true when she was talking. It <i>does</i> speak.
I heard it this morning when us was planning about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>not telling. Only I didn't listen," and the tears
rolled slowly down the little girl's face.</p>

<p>"I heard it too, sister. Yes, it's quite true,"
said Duke, beginning to sob. "But I can't go and
tell Grandmamma now. There's such a great deal
to tell; it isn't only about Toby. It's about having
said the bowls was empty," and Duke's sobs
redoubled. "Supposing&mdash;supposing, sister, us didn't
tell Grandmamma just this time, and us would never,
<i>never</i> not listen to that speaking inside us again?"</p>

<p>Pamela hesitated. She stood quite quite still,
her eyes gazing before her, but as if seeing nothing&mdash;she
seemed to be listening.</p>

<p>"Bruvver," she said at last, "I can't tell you yet.
I must fink. But I'm <i>almost</i> sure it's speaking now.
I'm almost sure it's saying us must tell."</p>

<p>"Oh don't, don't, Pamela," cried poor Duke; "you
mustn't say that. For I can't&mdash;I am sure I can't&mdash;tell
Grandmamma. And you won't tell without me
knowing, will you, sister?"</p>

<p>"For sure not," replied Pamela indignantly.
"Us must do it togevver like always. But there's
Miss Mitten coming&mdash;I hear her. Wait till after
she's gone, bruvver, and then I'll tell you what I've
been finking."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>With this Duke was obliged to content himself.
But he and Pamela took care to put away in a
shelf of the toy cupboard, where they would not be
seen, the remains of the broken bowl.</p>

<p>Miss Mitten had two very quiet and subdued
little pupils that morning. She noticed Duke's red
eyes, but, not being on very intimate terms with the
children, for she was rather a formal young person,
she said nothing about them. Only when lessons
were quite finished she told her pupils they might
tell their Grandmamma that they had been very
good and attentive.</p>

<p>"Your good Grandmamma will be pleased to
hear this," she said, "for she must be troubled about
poor Nurse's being ill. I hope you will do your
best to give her no trouble you can possibly avoid,"
and with these words Miss Mitten took her leave.</p>

<p>She had scarcely left when Biddy came to take
the children out a walk, and after that it was
their dinner-time, so that it was not till the afternoon
that they found themselves quite alone and
able to talk over their troubles. They had not
seen Grandmamma since the morning, for she had
gone out in the pony-carriage with Grandpapa to
pay some visits, which in those days were <i>really</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"morning calls"! and she had left word that after
their dinner Duke and Pamela might play in the
garden till she and Grandpapa came home.</p>

<p>"And when us sees them coming us'll ask
Grandpapa to tell Walters to drive us round to the
stable in the pony-carriage," said Duke, jumping up
and down in great excitement, quite forgetting his
troubles for the moment. But his forgetfulness did
not last long. Biddy began looking about the room
as if in search of something; she seemed vexed and
uneasy.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Biddy?" said Duke, stopping
in the midst of his gymnastics.</p>

<p>"Have you seen one of the china bowls anywhere
about, you or Miss Pamela, Master Duke?"
asked the girl. "Cook is so angry with me, and
she will have it I've broken it and won't tell," and
poor Biddy looked ready to cry.</p>

<p>"Didn't you miss it when you took the tray
down?" said Pamela, and Duke was astonished she
could speak so quietly.</p>

<p>"No," replied Biddy, "and then I <i>was</i> at fault,
for sure I gathered up the things quickly, and never
noticed there was but one bowl. And they must
have been both there, for you both had your break<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>fast.
The only thing I can think of is that some
one took it out of the room after you were downstairs,
master and missy," for it never occurred to
Biddy to think Duke or Pamela would have concealed
it had they broken the bowl, "but I'm
afeared Cook will lay it all on me."</p>

<p>"Do you fink they cost much&mdash;bowls like
these?" asked Pamela.</p>

<p>"Not so very much perhaps, but I don't think
I've ever seen any quite like them in any shop.
Besides, if even I could get to Sandle'ham to see,
it's a thing I daren't do. It's one of your Grandmamma's
strictest rules that if anything's broke
we're to tell. And I'm sure if I had broke it I
would tell."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Cook won't say anything more about
it," said Duke, but Biddy shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not to-day perhaps. She's busy to-day, for
two ladies and two gentlemen are coming to dinner.
But she'll be very angry with me when she comes
to send up your bread and milk to-morrow morning
if so be as the bowl isn't there."</p>

<p>"Are there only two like that?" asked Pamela.</p>

<p>"Your Grandmamma has some others, I think,
but they're kept locked up in a cupboard in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>china closet," said Biddy dolefully. "I'd tell my
mistress myself in a minute if I had broke it, but
the worst is, it will seem as if I have broke it and
won't tell, and that will make her very vexed with
me. But you must make haste to go out into the
garden, master and missy. It's such a fine day, and
if you stayed here it might wake Nurse. She's just
fallen asleep, and the doctor said she might be
better to-morrow if she got some sleep."</p>

<p>"Out in the garden" to-day it was lovely, for
though only April it was unusually bright and
warm. And the garden of Arbitt Lodge matched
the house. It was so quaint and neat, and yet
such a very delightful garden to play in, full of
queer little unexpected paths between high stiff
hedges that quite hid such small people as "us,"
leading to tiny bits of lawn, where one was sure to
find, if not a summer-house, at least a rustic bench
in a nice corner beside some old tree whose foliage
made a pleasant shade. Duke and Pamela had
given names of their own to some of the seats and
arbours, as they found this a great convenience for
their games, especially that of paying visits. I
think their favourite bench was one placed on what
they called "the hill;" that was a part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>garden banked up very high against the wall, from
which you could look down on the passers-by
without being seen by them, and the name of this
one was "Spy Tower." It was a nice place on a
sunny day, for the high trees made it shady, and
when they had no particular game they cared to
play it was always amusing to watch who passed.</p>

<p>This afternoon they did not feel in good enough
spirits to play, and almost without speaking they
walked quietly in the direction of "the hill."</p>

<p>"Us can see when Grandpapa and Grandmamma
are coming in time to run round and meet them at
the gate," said Pamela, as they climbed up the
bank.</p>

<p>"I don't think I want to see them coming, and
I don't want them to see us," said Duke. "Sister,
I am so midderable that I think if there was a big
sea near here I would go into it and be drowned."</p>

<p>"Bruvver!" ejaculated Pamela.</p>

<p>"Yes, sister," he continued, "it would be the
best thing. For if I was drown<i>ded</i> quite dead,
they'd all be so sorry that then you could tell them
about the bowl, and Biddy would not be scolded.
And&mdash;and&mdash;you could say it was far most <i>my</i>
fault, you know, for it was, and then they wouldn't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>be very angry with you. Yes," he repeated
solemnly, "it would be the best thing."</p>

<p>By this time Pamela was completely dissolved
in tears&mdash;tears of indignation as well as of grief.</p>

<p>"Bruvver," she began again, "how can you say
that? Us has always been togevver. How can
you fink I would <i>ever</i> say it was most your fault,
not if you was ever so drownded. But oh, bruvver,
don't frighten me so."</p>

<p>Duke's own tears were flowing too.</p>

<p>"There isn't any big sea near here," he said; "I
only said if there was. It's just that I am so very
midderable. I wish Nurse hadn't got ill."</p>

<p>"Oh, so do I," said Pamela fervently.</p>

<p>By this time they had reached Spy Tower.
Pamela seated herself discreetly on the bench,
though it was so much too high for her that her
short legs dangled in the air. Duke established
himself on the ground in front of her. It was a
very still day&mdash;more like late summer than spring&mdash;hardly
a leaf stirred, and in the distance various
sounds, the far-off barking of a dog, the faint crowing
and cackling of cocks and hens, the voices,
subdued to softness, "of the village boys and girls
at play," all mingled together pleasantly. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>children were too young to explain to themselves
the pleasant influences about them, of the soft sunshine
and the cloudless sky, seen through the network
of branches overhead, of the balmy air and
sweet murmurs of bird and insect life rejoicing in
the spring-time; but they felt them nevertheless.</p>

<p>"How very happy us would have been to-day
if it hadn't been for the bowl being brokened," said
Duke.</p>

<p>"No, it began before that," said Pamela. "It
was the not telling Grandmamma. I fink that was
the real naughty, bruvver. I don't <i>fink</i> Grandmamma
would have minded so much us giving the
bread and milk to Toby."</p>

<p>"Her wouldn't have given us any treat," objected
Duke.</p>

<p>"Well, that wouldn't have mattered very much
for once. And perhaps it would have been a good
fing; <i>perhaps</i> Grandmamma would have told Cook
not to send up quite so much, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why do you say that <i>now</i>?" said Duke rather
crossly; "it's only making it all worser and worser.
I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But what Duke wished was never to be known,
for just at that moment sounds coming down the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>lane, evidently drawing nearer and nearer, made
him start up and peep out from behind the few
thin low-growing shrubs at the top of the wall.</p>

<p>"Hush, sister," he said, quite forgetting that it
was himself and not "sister" who had been speaking,&mdash;"there
are <i>such</i> funny people coming down the
lane. Come here, close by me; there, you can see
them&mdash;don't they look funny?"</p>

<p>Pamela squeezed herself forward between Duke
and a bush, and looked where he pointed to. A little
group of people was to be seen making their way
slowly along the lane. There were a man, two women,
and two boys&mdash;the women with red kerchiefs over
their heads, and something picturesque about their
dress and bearing, though they were dirty and
ragged. They, as well as the man, had very dark
skins, black hair, and bright piercing eyes, and the
elder of the two boys, a great loose-limbed fellow
of sixteen or so, was just like them. But the other
boy, who did not look more than nine or ten, though
his skin was tanned by the weather nearly as brown
as his companion's, had lighter hair and eyes. He
followed the others at a little distance, not seeming
to attend to what they were saying, though they
were all talking eagerly, and rather loudly, in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>queer kind of language, which Duke and Pamela
could not understand at all. The younger boy
whistled as he came along, and he held a stout
branch in his hand, from which, with a short rough
knife, he was cutting away the twigs and bark. He
did not seem unhappy though he looked thin, and
his clothes hardly held together they were so ragged.</p>

<p>All these particulars became visible to the
children, as the party of gipsies&mdash;for such they
were, though of a low class&mdash;came nearer and
nearer. I forgot to say that the sixth member of
the party was a donkey, a poor half-starved looking
creature, with roughly-made panniers, stuffed
with crockery apparently, for basins and jugs and
pots of various kinds were to be seen sticking out
of them in all directions. And besides the donkey's
load there was a good deal more to carry, for the
man and the women and the big boy were all
loaded with bundles of different shapes and sizes,
and the little fellow had a sort of knapsack on his
back. They would probably have passed on their
way without dreaming of the two small people in
Spy Tower up above their heads, had not Duke,
suddenly catching sight of the donkey's burden,
exclaimed loudly to Pamela:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"See, see, sister; they have jugs and dishes.
Perhaps us could get a bowl like ours."</p>

<p>At the sound of the child's voice the man stopped
short in what he was saying to his companions, and
looked up.</p>

<p>"Good day, my little master, and my pretty
missy too," he said in a smooth voice, not the least
like the rather harsh tones in which he had been
speaking a moment before in the strange language.
"At your service, and is there anything I can do
for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh the pretty dears," exclaimed one of the
two women, while the other turned away with a
rough laugh, muttering something the children
could not distinguish the meaning of. "Oh the
pretty dears! Like two sweet birds up in a nest.
And wouldn't you like your fortunes told, my
honeys?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what that means," replied Duke,
feeling very valiant at the top of the wall. "I
want to know if you've got any china bowls to sell&mdash;bowls
for bread and milk, with little blue leaves
running over them."</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure," said the man. "We've
the very thing&mdash;it is strange, to be sure, that I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>should have just what the little master wants, isn't
it?" he went on, turning to the woman.</p>

<p>"If the gentleman and lady could come down
and look at them, they would see better," said she,
seizing the panniers with a great show of getting
out the crockery they contained.</p>

<p>"Us can't come down there," said Duke. "You
must come in at the gate, and us will meet you at
the back door."</p>

<p>The man and woman hesitated.</p>

<p>"Will the servants let us come so far, d'ye
think?" asked the man. "Are there no dogs about?
Must we say the little master and missy told us to
come for that they want to buy a bowl?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," cried Pamela hastily, "that wouldn't
do. The servants mustn't know."</p>

<p>The man glanced at the woman with a meaning
look.</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure," she said. "Master
and missy must please themselves. It's no business
of the servants. Perhaps it's for a little present
to their mamma they want one of our pretty
bowls?"</p>

<p>"Us hasn't any mamma," said Duke, "and it
isn't for a present, but still us doesn't want any one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>to know. Are you <i>sure</i> you've got any bowls just
like ours?"</p>

<p>"Certain sure," said the woman; "you see we've
such a many&mdash;if I was to get them all out you'd see.
Yours is blue&mdash;with leaves all over it&mdash;we've some,
sweet and pretty, with pink roses and green leaves."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the children, shaking their heads,
"that wouldn't do. It must be just the same."</p>

<p>"And have you got it there, then?" asked the
woman. "But that won't matter. You'll soon see
what beauties ours are. And so cheap! Not to
everybody of course as cheap as to you, but it isn't
often we see so pretty spoken a little gentleman
and lady as you. And you shall have them as
cheap as we can give them."</p>

<p>"Then us must get our money-box," said Duke.
"It's in the nursery cupboard. Will you go round
to near the back gate," and he pointed in the direction
he named, "and sister will go through the
garden to meet you, and I'll run in for our money-box."</p>

<p>The man peered about him, and again a sort of
meaning look passed between him and the woman.</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure," he said. "And pretty
missy will wait with us till you come. But don't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>be long, master, for we've a weary way to go afore
night."</p>

<p>"Poor things," said Pamela, "are you tired and
hungry? I wish us could ask you to come in and
rest, but you see Grandpapa and Grandmamma are
out and Nurse is ill, and there's no one to ask."</p>

<p>"Dear me, what a pity!" said the woman. "To
be sure we're tired and hungry, and it's not an easy
business to unpack the panniers, but anything to
please master and missy."</p>

<p>Just then the other woman, who had been standing
apart with the big boy all this time, called out
something in the same strange-sounding language.
And, apparently forgetting the children's presence,
the man roared out at her with such brutal roughness
that Duke and Pamela shrank back trembling.
The first woman hastened to reassure them.</p>

<p>"For shame, Mick," she said, and then with a
laugh she turned to the children. "It's just a way
he has. You must excuse him, master and missy.
And if little master will go quick for the money-box
it would be better. There won't be much in it, I
suppose, but it isn't much we'd want to take."</p>

<p>"Oh but there's a great deal," said Duke. "One
big guinea&mdash;that's between us, and two little ones,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>one each, and three shillings and a fourpenny of
mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And five sixpences and seven pennies of mine,"
said Pamela.</p>

<p>"Who'd a-thought it?" said the woman admiringly.
"I'd be pleased to see so much money for
once."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll show it you," said Duke, and off he
started. Pamela looked after him for a moment.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better," she said to the woman,
"if you saw a bit of the bowl, then you could find
the ones like it in a minute?"</p>

<p>"What a clever missy!" exclaimed the woman,
bent on flattery.</p>

<p>"Then I'll run after bruvver and fetch the bits,"
said Pamela, and, not heeding the woman's calling
after her that there was no need to give herself the
trouble, off she set too, overtaking Duke just before
he reached the house.</p>

<p>"I've come after you!" she exclaimed, breathless;
"I want to get the broken bits and then they'll
see what the bowl was like. And, bruvver,"&mdash;and
the little girl hesitated a little,&mdash;"I was <i>raver</i>
frightened to stay alone wif those people. The
man did speak so rough, didn't he?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Duke had felt very brave on the top of the wall,
and rather proud of himself for feeling so.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid when <i>I'm</i> there, sister,"
he said. "Besides they can't hurt us&mdash;us'll just
buy the bowl and run back with it. Us needn't
go farther than just by the back gate."</p>

<p>"Do you fink you should take <i>all</i> the money?"
asked Pamela doubtfully. "It can't cost all that."</p>

<p>"I'll not take the gold guineas, then," said Duke.
"At least," he went on, sorely divided between
caution and the wish to show off his riches, "I'll
only take <i>one</i>&mdash;just to let them see it. And one
shilling and one sixpence to let them see, and all
the pennies. You needn't be frightened, sister," he
repeated encouragingly, as the two trotted across the
garden again, "I won't let the man speak rude to
<i>you</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no one to be seen when they got to the
back gate. The children stood and looked about&mdash;Pamela
with the bits of broken crockery in her
apron held up in front, Duke tightly clasping the
precious money-box. They looked this way and
that way, up the lane and down the lane, but could
see nothing or nobody save Farmer Riggs' very old
horse turned out at the side of the hedge, and two
or three ducks who had perversely chosen to wander
out to grub about in a small pool of stagnant water
instead of gratefully enjoying their own nice clean
pond, as Grandmamma's ducks might have been
expected to do. At another time Duke and Pamela
would certainly have chased the stray ducks home
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>again, with many pertinent remarks on their naughty
disobedience, but just now they had no thought or
attention to give to anything but their own concerns.</p>

<p>A sudden feeling came over Pamela, and she
turned to Duke.</p>

<p>"Bruvver," she said, "those people hasn't come.
I fink they're not good people, and they won't come
near the house. I daresay they're somewhere down
the lane, not far off&mdash;but don't you <i>fink</i> perhaps us
had better not look for them any more, but just go
home, and when Grandmamma comes in tell her
<i>everyfing</i>. Even if she is raver angry, wouldn't it
be better, bruvver? I'm almost sure my little voice
inside is telling me so," and Pamela stood for a
moment with a look of intent listening on her
face. "Yes, I'm sure that's what it's trying to say.
Can you hear yours, bruvver?"</p>

<p>Duke looked undecided.</p>

<p>"I can't listen just now, sister," he replied.
"I'm full of thinking how nice it would be to buy
a bowl just the same, and take it in and give it to
poor Biddy, and then she wouldn't be scolded. I
don't think I'd mind telling Grandmamma once us
had got the bowl. She'd be so pleased to have one
the same."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>I</i> fink she'd be most pleased for us to tell her
everyfing," maintained Pamela stoutly.</p>

<p>And Duke, always impressed by her opinion,
wavered, and no doubt he would have wavered back
into the right way, had not, just at that moment, a
low whistle been heard some way to the left down
the lane; and, looking in the direction from whence
it came, the little boy and girl caught sight of a
head quickly poked out and as quickly drawn back
again into the shade of the hedge. But not too
quickly for them to have recognised the sharp black
eyes and rough black hair of the gipsy pedlar.</p>

<p>Without replying to Pamela Duke darted off,
and, though much against her will, the little girl
felt she could not but follow him. Before they had
quite reached the spot the head was poked out
again.</p>

<p>"I've had to wait here for you, master and
missy," said the man. "There were some farmers
men down that way, round the corner," and he
jerked his thumb&mdash;for he had by this time come
out of his hole&mdash;in an imaginary direction, "as said
this were a private road, and they'd set dogs on us
if we came on. I'm a peaceable fellow, and not
fond o' fightin', so I'd just have gone on my way out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>of their road but for promisin' you to come round
this way."</p>

<p>"It's very strange," said Duke; "I don't know
what it means about a private road, but I know
everybody always passes this way&mdash;that's why us
likes Spy Tower so much, there's so many people
passing."</p>

<p>"It's all along of our being poor folk," said the
man; "there's no fair play for poor folk. But I'm
one as keeps his word, so here I am. And the
donkey and the missus are down the road there
waiting&mdash;there's a little wood where we thought
nobody would disturb us for a bit, if you and missy
will come so far&mdash;the missus said she'd unpack the
pots. But you must be quick&mdash;I dursn't hang
about here, and if you can't come there's no more
to be said," and he turned as if to go.</p>

<p>"Just wait one instant, please," said Pamela
hastily, extracting one of the fragments from her
apron; "just look at this. It's no use our going to
see the bowls if you've none the same&mdash;do you fink
you have any like this?"</p>

<p>The man pretended to start.</p>

<p>"Well, that is cur'ous," he said. "If my eyes
is not deceivin' me, that's the very pattern we've a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>whole set on&mdash;the bowls shouldn't ought to be sold
separate, but to oblige you we'll see what the missus
will do," and again he turned to go.</p>

<p>The children looked at each other. They had
never before in their lives been outside the gates
alone; of this back road and where it led to they
knew very little, as it was always on the other road&mdash;that
leading to Sandlingham&mdash;that Nurse liked to
walk. They did not remember the little wood the
man spoke of, but they did not like to contradict
him; then, if it was only such a little way, they
could run back in a minute when they had got the
bowl, and all would be right. So they took each
other's hands and followed the man, who was already
striding some steps in front down the lane, glancing
behind him over his shoulder from time to time to
see if the little couple had made up their minds.</p>

<p>A few minutes' quick walking on his part, necessitating
something between a trot and a run on
theirs, brought them out of the lane into the high
road. Here the man stopped short for a moment
and looked about him&mdash;the children supposed in
search of his companions and the donkey. But
there was no one and nothing to be seen.</p>

<p>"I don't think us can come any farther," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Duke rather timidly. The man turned round with
a scowl on his face, but in a moment he had smoothed
it away and spoke in the same oily tones.</p>

<p>"It's just a step farther," he said, "and I can
take you a shorter way through the fields than the
missus could go with the donkey. This way, master
and missy," and he quickly crossed the road, still
glancing up and down, and, climbing over a stile,
stood beckoning for the children to follow.</p>

<p>They had never noticed this stile before; they
had not the slightest idea where it led to, but somehow
they felt more afraid now to turn back than to
go on; and, indeed, it would not have been any use,
for, had he cared to do so, the man could have
overtaken them in a moment. The stile was hard
for their short legs to climb, but they had a great
dislike to the idea of his touching them, and would
not ask for help. And once he had got them on
the other side of it he seemed to feel he had them
in his power, and did not take much notice of them,
but strode on through the rough brushwood&mdash;for
they were by this time in a sort of little coppice&mdash;as
if he cared for nothing but to get over the ground
as fast as possible. And still the two followed him&mdash;through
the coppice, across one or two ploughed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>fields, down a bit of lane where they had never
been before, plunging at last into a wood where the
trees grew thick and dark&mdash;a forest of gloom it
seemed to Duke and Pamela&mdash;and all this time
they never met a creature, or passed any little
cottage such as they were accustomed to see on the
cheerful Sandlingham road. The pedlar knew the
country, and had chosen the least frequented way.
Had they by any chance met a carriage or cart,
even when crossing the high road, he would not
have dared to risk being seen with the children, but
in that case he would no doubt have hurried off,
leaving them to find their way home as best they
might. But no such good fortune having befallen
them, on they trotted&mdash;hand-in-hand for the most
part, though by this time several stumbles had
scratched and bruised them, and their flying hair,
flushed faces and tumbled clothes made them look
very different from the little "master and missy"
Biddy had sent out into the peaceful garden to play
that sweet April afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Why</i> they went on, they could not themselves
have told. Often in after years, and when they had
grown older and wiser, they asked themselves the
question. It was not exactly fear, for as yet the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>man had not actually spoken roughly to them, nor
was it altogether a feeling of shame at giving in&mdash;it
was a mixture of both perhaps, and some strange
sort of fascination that even very wise people might
not find it easy to explain. For every time their
steps lagged, and they felt as if they could go no
farther, a glance over his shoulder of the man in
front seemed to force them on again. And as the
wood grew closer and darker this feeling increased.
They felt as if they were miles and miles from
home, in some strange and distant country they
had never before seen or heard of; they seemed to
be going on and on, as in a dream. And though
poor little Pamela still, through all her stumbles
and tumbles, held tightly up before her the corners
of her apron, containing the bits of the unlucky
bowl, and Duke, on his side, still firmly clutched
his precious money-box, I do not believe either of
them had by this time any very clear remembrance
of why they were laden with these queer burdens,
or what was the object of the strange and painful
expedition.</p>

<p>And still on strode the piercing-eyed gipsy, as
sure of his prey now apparently as a fowler who
watches unmoved the fruitless struggles of some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>poor little birds in the net from which they have
no chance of escaping.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to say how far they had
gone&mdash;perhaps not so very far after all, though
their panting breath and trembling little legs
showed that the gipsy's purpose of tiring them out
was pretty well accomplished&mdash;when at last a sharp
cry from Pamela forced the pedlar to look round.
She had caught her foot on a stone or a root, and
fallen, and in falling one of the jagged bits of the
broken crockery had cut her leg pretty deeply;
the blood was already streaming from it, her little
white sock was deeply stained, and she lay on the
ground almost fainting with terror and pain.</p>

<p>"Stop that screaming, will ye?" said the man,
and then, with a half return to his former tone,
"There's nothing to cry about, missy. It's just a
scratch&mdash;I'll tie it up with a bit of rag," and he
began fumbling about in his dirty pockets as he
spoke. "There's the donkey and the others waiting
for us just five minutes farther;" and for once
the gipsy spoke the truth. The way he had
brought the children was in reality a great round,
chosen on purpose to bewilder them, so that the
rest of his party had been able to reach the meeting-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>place
he had appointed very much more quickly
by the road.</p>

<p>But Pamela, once thoroughly upset and frightened,
was not to be so easily calmed down.</p>

<p>"No, no," she screamed, "I won't let him touch
me. Go away, go away, you ugly man," she cried,
pushing him back with her tiny hands when he
tried to come near. "I <i>won't</i> let you touch me or
carry me," for that now seemed to be the gipsy's
intention, "leave me here with Duke; we don't
want you any more."</p>

<p>The man's dark face grew darker with the
scowl that came over it. For half a moment he
seemed on the point of seizing Pamela in his arms
in spite of her cries and resistance. But there was
Duke too to be considered; Pamela alone it would
be easy to cover up, so that her cries should not be
heard; but he could not carry both, and if the boy
ran after them screaming, or if he tried to run
home, to ask for help&mdash;for "home" was really not
far off&mdash;there was no knowing what trouble the
anything but blessed "brats" might bring upon
worthy Mick and his horde! So that respectable
gentleman decided on different tactics.</p>

<p>"You're a very naughty little girl," he said&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>speaking,
however, not roughly, but more as if
Pamela's behaviour really shocked and hurt him.
"After all the trouble I've give myself for you&mdash;a-goin'
out of my road, and a-unpackin' all
the pots and crocks down there, for to please
you. Not even to let me tie up your foot or carry
you to the missus for her to do it! Well, if you
lie there till you bleed to death, it's no fault o'
mine."</p>

<p>But Duke's presence of mind had returned by
this time.</p>

<p>"I'll tie up her foot with my hankercher," he
said, producing the little twelve-inch square of
linen, which for a wonder he found in his pocket,
on the whole much cleaner than could have been
expected. And though he grew white and sick
with the sight of the streaming blood, he managed
without any opposition from his sister to strap it
up after a fashion, the gipsy looking on in silence.</p>

<p>"You can go now, thank you," said Duke, his
voice trembling in spite of himself. "Us don't
mind about the bowl&mdash;it's too far to go. Us will
tell Grandmamma all about it&mdash;Oh how I do
wish us had told her at first," he broke off suddenly.
"Please go," he went on again to the pedlar; "sister's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>frightened. I'll stay here with her till her foot's
better, and then us'll go home."</p>

<p>"And how will ye do that, I'd like to know,
my young master?" said the pedlar, and there was
a mocking tone in his voice that made the boy look
up at him with fresh alarm. "Ye're furder from
'home' than ye think for. No, no; here ye'll have
to stay till I fetch the donkey to carry you both.
And to think of all that trouble and time lost for
nothing."</p>

<p>"They'll give you something at home for bringing
us back; they will indeed," said Duke. "Grandpapa
and Grandmamma will be so pleased to see us
safe again, I <i>know</i> they'll give you something," he
repeated, while a sob rose in his throat at the
thought that already perhaps dear Grandpapa and
Grandmamma&mdash;never had they seemed <i>so</i> dear!&mdash;were
wondering and troubled about their absence.
And somehow he quite forgot that he himself could
reward the gipsy, for in attending to Pamela's
wounded foot he had laid down the money-box, and
no longer remembered that he had it with him.</p>

<p>The gipsy grunted, and muttered something
about "making sure" that Duke scarcely heard.
Then he turned to go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm off for the donkey then. But mind you
the stiller you stays in this here wood the better,"
he added impressively. "That's why I didn't like
missy crying out so loud. It's a queer place&mdash;a
<i>very</i> queer place. I'se warrant your Nurse never
brought you this way when you were out a-walking."</p>

<p>"No, never," said Duke, startled, and even
Pamela left off sobbing to stare up at him with her
tearful blue eyes, as if fascinated by these mysterious
hints.</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought not," he said, nodding his head.
"Well, stay where you are, and make no sound whatsumnever,
and no harm'll come to ye. But if you
stir or speak even above a whisper," and he lowered
his own voice, "there's no saying. There's beasts
you never heard tell of in this wood&mdash;worsest of
all, snakes, that think nothing of twisting round a
child and off with it for their supper afore one could
cry out. But if you stop quite still they'll not find
you out before I'm back with the donkey. It's
about their time o' day for sleeping just now, I'm
thinking," and with this crumb of consolation the
cruel-hearted gipsy turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Words would fail me to describe the terror of
the two poor little children: a cry of appeal to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
pedlar to stay beside them, not to leave them to the
dreadful creatures he spoke of, rose to their lips, but
stopped there. For were they not almost as terrified
of him as of the snakes? Pamela forgot all about
her wounded foot, though it was growing stiff with
pain, and the blood, which Duke's unskilful binding
had not succeeded in checking, was still flowing in
a way that would have alarmed more experienced
eyes. It was cold too&mdash;and terror made them
colder&mdash;for the evening was drawing on, and it was
only April. Yet they dared not move&mdash;Pamela
indeed could not have stood up&mdash;and so there they
stayed, Duke crouched beside his sister, who lay
almost at full length on the short tufty grass, among
the roots and stumps, for just here a good deal of
wood had been cut down. There was no fear of
their moving&mdash;the shivers and sobs that they could
not control added to their fears&mdash;they would have
left off breathing even, if they could have managed
it, rather than risk betraying their presence to the
snakes!</p>

<p>But after some minutes&mdash;not more than five
probably, though it seemed more like five hours&mdash;had
passed the silence and strain grew unbearable
to Duke. He peeped at Pamela; her eyes were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>closed, she looked so dreadfully white!&mdash;his heart
gave such a thump that he looked round for a
moment in terror, it seemed to him such a loud
noise,&mdash;what could make her look so? Could the
fear and the pain have killed her?</p>

<p>"Pamela," he whispered, in what he meant to be a
very low whisper indeed; "Oh, sister, are you dead?"</p>

<p>Her eyelids fluttered a little, and she half opened
them.</p>

<p>"No, bruvver; at least I don't fink so," she said,
and her whisper was very faint without her trying
to make it so, for she was really quite exhausted.
"I wasn't sure a minute ago, but I fink now I'm
only dying. But don't speak, for the snakes might
hear."</p>

<p>"They're asleep, he said," returned Duke, with a
sob of anguish at Pamela's words.</p>

<p>"But some might be awake. If it wasn't for
that, oh, bruvver, you might run away, and perhaps
you'd get safe home. Couldn't you <i>try</i>, bruvver?"
and Pamela half raised herself on her arm.</p>

<p>"And leave <i>you</i>, sister!" cried Duke indignantly,
forgetting to whisper; "how could you think I'd
ever do such a thing? If I could <i>carry</i> you&mdash;oh
what a pity it is I'm not much bigger than you!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>"You couldn't carry <i>me</i>," said Pamela feebly,
and her head sank back again; "and the snakes
would hear us and catch us. But oh, bruvver, I'm
afraid I'll be quite dead before the man comes back
again, and yet I don't want him to come."</p>

<p>Almost in despair Duke sat up and looked round
for any possibility of help. It was nearer than he
thought; and yet when a voice, apparently a very
little way off, called out, as if in answer to his
unspoken appeal&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm a-coming. Don't ye be afeared," he started
with new terror.</p>

<p>"A snake!&mdash;Oh, sister, can it be a snake?" he
cried wildly, for there was nothing to be seen.</p>

<p>"Snakes don't talk, as ever I heard on," said the
voice again, and this time it was accompanied by a
merry laugh, which brought great comfort to poor
Duke. And in another moment the mystery was
explained.</p>

<p>From behind some stubble a few yards off rose
the figure of the young boy whom the children had
seen walking behind the gipsies&mdash;whistling while
he cut at a branch he held in his hand&mdash;from their
point of observation in Spy Tower. His face was
tanned and freckled by the sun, but his fair hair and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>bright blue eyes showed that he was not by birth
one of the dark-skinned tribe; and something in
the bright smile, showing a row of teeth as white
and even as Duke's own, and in the cheerful voice,
at once gained the little boy's confidence.</p>

BOY WHOM THE CHILDREN HAD SEEN WALKING BEHIND THE GIPSIES&mdash;WHISTLING<br />
WHILE HE CUT AT A BRANCH HE HELD IN HIS HAND.</small>&mdash;p. <a href='#Page_74'>74</a>. </div>

<p>"I've been looking for ye," he said, speaking in
a rather lower tone. "I knew he was a-going to
bring ye round this way, so I hid in the bushes till
I see'd him go by. And I crep' along on my hands
and knees for fear he should look back. But he's
out o' the way for a few minutes. It's only a bit
of a step to where the others is, but he said something
about the donkey, didn't he? It'll take him
a bit to unload it. An' what's he been a-doing to
ye?" he went on, glancing round till his eyes for
the first time caught sight clearly of the little figure
stretched on the ground. "He's never gone and
dared to hit the little lady?" and the good-humoured
face grew dark and almost fierce as he stooped down
close to Pamela. She looked pitiable enough; her
face had grown whiter and whiter, her eyes were
still closed, and the blood from her foot had crept
about her as she lay till it had soiled the frills of
her little white skirts.</p>

<p>"No," said Duke; "no, it's her foot. The bits
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>of the bowl cut it when she felled down. I tied
it up with my hankercher, but it hasn't left off
bleeding."</p>

<p>The boy did not speak, he was too busy examining
the poor foot, which he handled so tenderly that
Pamela did not shrink from his touch. At last he
looked up.</p>

<p>"I say, master," he said, "we must have some
water for this 'ere foot. Just you sit down where I
am and hold it so; it won't bleed so bad that way,
and I'll get some water. There's some hard by,"
and he looked round. "If I had but something to
fetch some in."</p>

<p>"There's my money-box," said Duke, with a
sudden flash of recollection, "it would hold a little,"
and in his turn he looked round. But no money-box
was to be seen. "Oh where can it be?" he
cried. "I know I had it when sister felled."</p>

<p>"Was there summat in it?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied Duke; "one of the little gold
guineas, and one of my shillings, and one of sister's
sixpennies, and all the pennies."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the boy, "then I'm afeared you've
said good-bye to the lot o' them. Catch Mick let
fish like that out of his net. But," he added&mdash;for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Duke seemed to be stunned by the loss&mdash;"sit ye
down, and I'll fetch what water I can in my cap, or
we'll have missy's foot very bad, and that 'ud be
worser than losin' the money."</p>

<p>He was back in a moment with water enough
to soak the diminutive handkerchief, with which
he gently bathed away some of the blood, so that
he could see the wound. It was a bad cut, but it
was not now bleeding so much. The little surgeon
pressed the sides gently together, which made
Pamela give a little scream of pain.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, missy dear," he said. "It'll not
hurt so much when I've tied it up. Ye've not
another hankerwich? I'd like to lay this one over
the cut&mdash;it's nice and wet&mdash;and tie it on with
summat else."</p>

<p>"I fink there's one in my pocket," said Pamela,
and when Duke had extracted it, and with its help
the poor foot was tied up much more scientifically
than before, she sat up and looked about her, less
white and miserable by a good deal, thanks to their
new friend.</p>

<p>"What a nice boy you are," she said condescendingly.
"What's your name? Is that&mdash;&mdash; ugly
man" she was going to have said, but she hesitated,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>afraid of hurting the boy's feelings&mdash;"is the man
your father?" and she dropped her voice.</p>

<p>"Bless yer, no," he replied with real fervency,
"and that's one thing I'm thankful for. Mick my
father; <i>no</i>, thank you, missy. My name's Tim,
leastways so I'm called. Diana she says it's short
for Timothy, but Tim's long enough."</p>

<p>"And who's Diana?" asked the children, beginning
to forget their own troubles in curiosity.</p>

<p>"Her as he roared out at so&mdash;yonder&mdash;when
you was up at the top o' the wall. She's a deal
better than him and the missus is Diana. But
listen, master and missy. He'll be back in a
minute, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh let us run away before he comes! oh do
help us to run away!" they exclaimed, all their
terrors returning. "Us doesn't want the bowl now.
Oh Tim, can't us all run away, quick, before he
comes?"</p>

<p>And the two little creatures seized hold of their
new friend's ragged jacket as if they felt that in
him was their only chance of safety.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>They were so excited, so eager to be off at once,
that for a minute or two Tim could scarcely get
them to listen to him. They had forgotten all
about the snakes, or else their confidence in the boy
as a protector was so great that they were sure he
would defend them against every danger.</p>

<p>"Oh Tim, dear Tim, do let us go quick," they
kept repeating.</p>

<p>"But master and missy," he explained at last
when they would let him speak, "we can't. Don't
you see Mick knows exactly where he left yer, and
he'd be after us in a minute. There's nowhere near
here where we could hide but what he'd find us.
You'd only get me a beating, that 'ud be all about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>it. No, listen to me. P'raps Mick means to take
yer home straight away, but if he doesn't we must
wait a bit till I can find out what he's after. He's
a deep one is Mick."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you run home quick to tell Grandpapa
and Grandmamma where us is?" said Duke.
"Grandpapa, and the coachman, and Dymock, and
the gardener&mdash;they'd all come to fetch us."</p>

<p>"I dursn't," said Tim. "Not yet; Mick's a
deep one. If he thought I'd run off to tell
he'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What would he do?" they asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"He'd hide away somehow. 'Twouldn't be so
easy to find him. He'll be back in a moment too&mdash;I
couldn't get off before he'd be after me. No; we
must wait a bit till I see what he's after."</p>

<p>"Why haven't you runned away before?" asked
Pamela. "If he's not your father, and if you don't
like him."</p>

<p>"Nowhere to run to," said Tim simply. "It's
not so bad for me. I'm used to it. It's not like
you, master and missy. Diana and me, when you
was up at the top o' the wall, we'd ha' done anything
to stop you coming down."</p>

<p>"But, Tim," said Pamela, almost in a whisper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
"you don't mean that Mick's going to steal us away
for always."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the boy, "he only wants to get
some money for you. But we'll see in a bit. Just
you stay there quiet till he comes, and don't you
say you've seen me. I'll soon see you again; but
he mustn't find me here."</p>

<p>They began to cry again when he left them, but
he had not gone too soon; for in less than five
minutes&mdash;by which time Tim had hidden himself
some little way off&mdash;they heard the voice of the
gipsy urging on the donkey over the rough ground.
He seemed in a very bad temper, and Duke and
Pamela shivered with fear.</p>

<p>"Oh I wish us had runned away," whispered
Pamela, though, when she tried to lift herself
up and found she could not put the wounded
foot to the ground even so as to hobble, she
felt that to escape would have been impossible.
The gipsy scowled at them, but said nothing as
he lifted first the boy and then the girl on to the
donkey.</p>

<p>"There, now," he said, with a slight return to
his falsely-smooth tones, "you'll be pleased at last,
I should hope. To think of all the trouble we've
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>had, the missus and me, a-unpacking of all the pots
and crocks for you to ride on the donkey."</p>

<p>"And are you going to take us straight home,
then?" said Pamela, whose spirits had begun to
revive.</p>

<p>"What, without the bowl?" exclaimed Mick, in
pretended surprise, "when there's such a lot all set
out on the grass in a row for you to see."</p>

<p>He spoke so naturally that both the children
were deceived for the moment. Perhaps after all
he was not so bad&mdash;even Tim had said <i>perhaps</i> he
was going to take them home! They looked up at
him doubtfully.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, please," said Duke, "us'd
rather go home. It doesn't matter about the bowl,
for sister's foot's so sore and it's getting late. I'll
give you all the money&mdash;oh please, where have
you put my money-box?"</p>

<p>Greatly to his surprise, the gipsy pulled it out
of some slouching inner pocket of his jacket and
gave it to him.</p>

<p>"Here it is, master; but it'd a' been lost but for
me&mdash;a-laying on the ground there."</p>

<p>Duke opened it.</p>

<p>"I'll give you&mdash;&mdash;" he began again, but he sud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>denly
stopped short. "The little gold guinea's not
here," he cried, "only the shilling and the sixpence
and the pennies."</p>

<p>"Must have rolled out on the ground if ever it
was there," said Mick sullenly. "<i>I</i> never see'd it."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> there," cried Duke angrily. "Do you
think I'd tell a story? I must go back and look
for it. Let me down, I say, let me down."</p>

<p>Then Mick turned on him with a very evil
expression on his face.</p>

<p>"Stop that, d'ye hear? Stop that," and he
lifted his fist threateningly. "D'ye think I'm
going to waste any more time on such brats and
their nonsense? Catch me a-taking you home for
you to go and say I've stolen your money, and get
me put in prison by your grandpapas and grandmammas
as likely as not," he went on in a half-threatening,
half-whining tone.</p>

<p>Duke was going to answer, but Pamela pulled
his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, bruvver," she said in a whisper.
"Tim said us must wait a bit."</p>

<p>Almost as she said the words a voice was heard
whistling at a little distance&mdash;they were now out
of the wood on a rough bridle path. Mick looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>round sharply and descried a figure coming near
them.</p>

<p>"What have you been about, you good-for-nothing?"
he shouted. "Why didn't you stay
with the others? You might have lent me a hand
with the donkey and the brats."</p>

<p>Tim stood still in the middle of the path, and
stared at them without speaking. Then he turned
round and walked beside Mick, who was leading
the donkey.</p>

<p>"What are ye a-doing with the little master
and missy?" he asked coolly.</p>

<p>"Mind yer business," muttered the gipsy gruffly.
Then he added in a louder tone, "Master and missy
has lost their way, don't ye see? They're ever so
far from home. It was lucky I met them."</p>

<p>"Are ye a-going to take them home?" continued
Tim.</p>

<p>"For sure, when I can find the time. But that
won't be just yet a bit. There's the missus a-waiting
for us."</p>

<p>And, turning a corner, they came suddenly in
sight of the other gipsies&mdash;the two women and the
big sulky-looking boy&mdash;gathered round a tree, the
donkey's panniers and the various bundles the party
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>had been carrying lying on the ground beside
them. If the panniers had been unpacked and
their contents spread out, as Mick had told the
children, they had certainly been quickly packed
up again. But there was no time for wondering
about how this could be; the woman whom the
pedlar called "the missus" came up to her husband
as soon as she saw them, and said a few words
hastily, and with a look of great annoyance, in the
queer language she had spoken before, to which he
replied with some angry expression which it was
probably well the children did not understand.</p>

<p>"Better have done with it, I should say," said
the other woman, who was much younger and
nicer-looking, but still with a rather sullen and
discontented face.</p>

<p>"That's just like her," said Mick. "What we'd
come to if we listened to her talk it beats me to
say."</p>

<p>"You've not come to much good by not listening
to it," retorted Diana fiercely. But Tim, who had
gone towards her, said something in a low voice
which seemed to calm her.</p>

<p>"It's true&mdash;we'll only waste our time if we take
to quarrelling," she said. "What's to be done, then?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must put the panniers back, and the girl
must sit between them somehow," said the man.
"She can't walk&mdash;the boy must run beside."</p>

<p>So saying, he lifted both children off the donkey,
not so gently but that Pamela gave a cry as her
sore foot touched the ground. But no one except
Duke paid any attention to her, not even Tim,
which she thought very unkind of him. She said
so in a low voice to Duke, but he whispered to her
to be quiet.</p>

<p>"If only my foot was not sore, now us could
have runned away," she could not help whispering
again. For all the gipsies seemed so busy in
loading themselves and the donkey that for a few
minutes the children could have fancied they had
forgotten all about them. It was not so, however.
As soon as the panniers were fastened on again
Mick turned to Pamela, and, without giving her
time to resist, placed her again on the donkey. It
was very uncomfortable for her; her poor little legs
were stretched out half across the panniers, and she
felt that the moment the donkey moved she would
surely fall off. So, as might have been expected,
she began to cry. The gipsy was turning to her
with some rough words, when Diana interfered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me settle her," she said. "What a fool
you are, Mick!" Then she drew out of her own
bundle a rough but not very dirty checked wool
shawl, with which she covered the little girl, who
was shivering with cold, and at the same time
made a sort of cushion for her with one end of it,
so that she could sit more securely.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Pamela, amidst her sobs;
"but oh I hope it's not very far to home."</p>

<p>Mick stood looking on, and at this he gave a
sneering laugh.</p>

<p>"It's just as well to have covered her up," he
said. "Isn't there another shawl as'd do for the
boy? Not that it matters; we'll meet no one the
road we're going. The sooner we're off the better."</p>

<p>He took hold of the bridle and set off as fast as
he could get the donkey to go. Diana kept her
place beside it, so that, even if Pamela had fallen
off, it would only have been into the young woman's
arms. Duke followed with Tim and the other
woman, but he had really to "run," as Mick had
said, for his short legs could not otherwise have
kept up with the others. He was soon too out of
breath to speak&mdash;besides, he dared not have said
anything to Tim in the hearing of "the missus," of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>whom he was almost more afraid than even of
Mick. And the only sign of friendliness Tim, on
his side, dared show him was by taking his hand
whenever he thought the woman would not notice.
But, tired as he was already, Duke could not long
have kept up; he felt as if he <i>must</i> have cried out,
when suddenly they came to a turning in the road
and the gipsy stopped.</p>

<p>"We'll get back into the wood this way," he
said, without turning his head, and with some difficulty
he managed to get the donkey across a dry
ditch, and down a steep bank, when, sure enough,
they found themselves again among trees. It was
already dusk, and a very little way on in the wood it
became almost dark. The gipsy went on some distance
farther&mdash;obliged, however, to go very slowly;
then at last he stopped.</p>

<p>"This'll do for to-night," he said. "I'm about
sick of all this nonsense, I can tell ye. We might
ha' been at Brigslade to-night if it hadn't been for
these brats."</p>

<p>"Then do as I say," said Diana. "I'll manage
it for you. Big Tony can carry one, and I the
other."</p>

<p>But Mick only turned away with an oath.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="three" id="three"></a><img src="./images/003.jpg" alt="HERE'S SOME SUPPER FOR YOU. WAKE UP, AND TRY AND EAT A BIT." title="HERE'S SOME SUPPER FOR YOU. WAKE UP, AND TRY AND EAT A BIT." /></div>

<div class='center'><small>"HERE'S SOME SUPPER FOR YOU. WAKE UP, AND TRY AND EAT A BIT. IT'LL DO<br />
YOU GOOD."</small>&mdash;p. <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Big Tony was the name of the gipsy boy. He
never spoke, and never seemed to take any interest
in anything, for he was half-witted, as it is called;
though Duke and Pamela only thought him very
sulky and silent compared with the friendly little
Tim. By this time they were too completely tired
to think about anything&mdash;they even felt too stupid
to wonder if they were on the way home or not&mdash;and
when Diana lifted Pamela off the donkey and
set her down, still wrapped in the shawl, to lean
with her back against a tree, Duke crept up to her,
drawing a corner of the shawl round him, for he
too was very cold by now, poor little boy&mdash;and sat
there by his sister, both of them in a sort of half
stupor, too tired even to know that they were very
hungry!</p>

<p>They did fall asleep&mdash;though they did not know
it till they were roused by some one gently pulling
them.</p>

<p>"Here's some supper for you. Wake up, and
try and eat a bit. It'll do you good," the gipsy
Diana was saying to them; and when they managed
to open their sleepy eyes, they saw that she had a
wooden bowl in one hand, in which some hot coffee
was steaming, and a hunch of bread in the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
It was not very good coffee, and neither Duke nor
Pamela was accustomed to coffee of any kind at
home, but it was hot and sweet, and they were so
hungry that even the coarse butterless bread tasted
good. As they grew more awake they began to
wonder how the coffee had been made, but the
mystery was soon explained, for at a short distance
a fire of leaves and branches was burning brightly
with a kettle sputtering merrily in the middle.
And round the fire Mick and his wife and big
Tony were sitting or lying, each with food in their
hands; while a little nearer them Tim was pulling
another shawl out of a bundle.</p>

<p>"Give it me here," said Diana, and then she
wrapped it round Duke, drawing the other more
closely about Pamela.</p>

<p>"Now you can go to sleep again," she said,
seeing that the coffee and bread had disappeared.
"It'll not be a cold night, and we'll have to be off
early in the morning;" and then she turned away and
sat down to eat her own supper at a little distance.</p>

<p>"Tim," whispered Duke; but the boy caught
the faint sound and edged himself nearer.</p>

<p>"Tim," said Duke again, "is he not going to take
us home to-night?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'se a-feared not," replied Tim in the same tone.</p>

<p>A low deep sigh escaped poor Duke. Pamela,
so worn out by the pain as well as fatigue she had
suffered that she could no longer keep up, was
already fast asleep again.</p>

<p>"When it's quite, quite dark," continued Duke,
"and when Mick and them all are asleep, don't you
think us might run away, Tim?"</p>

<p>Tim shook his head.</p>

<p>"Missy can't walk; and she's dead tired out, let
alone her poor foot," he said. "You must wait a
bit till she can walk anyway. Try to go to sleep,
and to-morrow we'll see."</p>

<p>Duke began to cry quietly.</p>

<p>"I'm too midderable to sleep," he said. "And
it's all my fault. Just look at sister, Tim. She's not
even undressed, and she'll die&mdash;sleeping all night
without any bed out in the cold. Oh, and it's all
my fault!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, master!" said Tim, terrified lest
the others should overhear them.</p>

<p>"What does he want to do with us? Why
won't he take us home?" asked Duke.</p>

<p>Tim hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"I thought at first it was just to get money for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>bringing of ye back," he said. "I've known him do
that."</p>

<p>"But us would tell," said Duke indignantly.
"Us would tell that he wouldn't let us go home."</p>

<p>"Ah, he'd manage so as 'twouldn't matter what
you said," replied Tim. "He'd get some pal of his
to find you like, and then he'd get the money back
from him."</p>

<p>"What's a pal?" asked Duke bewildered.</p>

<p>"Another like hisself; a friend o' his'n," said
Tim. "But that's not what he's after. I found out
what it is. There's a show at some big place we're
going to; and they want pretty little ones like you
and little missy, to dress them up and teach them
to dance, and to play all sort o' tricks&mdash;a-riding
on ponies and suchlike, I daresay. I'se seen them.
And Mick'll get a good deal that way. I'd bet
anything, and so'd Diana, that's what he's after."</p>

<p>"But us'd <i>tell</i>," repeated Duke, "us'd tell that he'd
stoled us away, and they'd have to let us go home."</p>

<p>Again Tim shook his head.</p>

<p>"Those as 'ud pay Mick for ye wouldn't give
much heed to aught you'd say," he answered.
"And it'll maybe be a long way off from here&mdash;over
the sea maybe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," said Duke, "then us <i>must</i> run away, Tim.
And if you won't help us, us'll run away alone, as
soon as ever sister's foot's better. Us <i>must</i>, Tim."</p>

<p>He had raised his voice in his excitement, so
that Tim glanced anxiously in the direction of the
fire. But Mick and his wife seemed to have fallen
asleep themselves, or perhaps the wind rustling
overhead among the branches prevented the child's
little voice reaching them; they gave no signs of
hearing. All the same it was best to be cautious.</p>

<p>"Master," said Tim solemnly, "I'm ready to
help you. I said so to Diana, I did, as soon as
ever I see'd what Mick was after, a-tempting you
and missy with his nonsense about the bowl you
wanted; there's no bowls like what you wanted
among the crocks."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you call out to us and tell us not
to come?" said Duke.</p>

<p>"I dursn't&mdash;and Mick'd have told you it was
all my lies. And I never thought he was a-going
to bring you right away neither. I thought he'd
get money out of you like he does whenever he's a
chance. But, master, if you're ever to get safe
away you must do as I tell you, you must."</p>

<p>This was all the comfort poor Duke could get.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
In the meantime there was nothing to do but try
to go to sleep and forget his troubles. There was
not very much time to do so in, for long before it
was really dawn the gipsies were up and astir, and
by noon the little brother and sister were farther
from "home" than they had ever been since the
day when their poor young mother arrived at Arbitt
Lodge with her two starved-looking fledglings, now
nearly six years ago. For some miles from where
they had spent the night Mick and his party joined
a travelling caravan of their friends, all bound for
the great fair of which Tim had spoken to Duke.
And now it would have been difficult for even
Grandpapa or Grandmamma to recognise their dear
children. Their own clothes were taken from them,
their white skin, like that of the princesses in the
old fairy tales, was washed with something which, if
not walnut juice, had the same effect, and they were
dressed in coarse rough garments belonging to some of
the gipsy children of the caravan. Still, on the whole,
they were not unkindly treated&mdash;they had enough to
eat of common food, and Diana, who took them a
good deal under her charge, was kind to them in her
rough sulky way. But it was a dreadful change for
the poor little things, and they would already have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>tried, at all risks, to run away, had it not been for
Tim's begging them to be patient and trust to him.</p>

<p>All day long&mdash;it was now the third day since
they had been stolen&mdash;the two or three covered
vans or waggons which contained the gipsies and
their possessions jogged slowly along the roads and
lanes. Now and then they halted for a few hours
if they came to any village or small town where it
seemed likely that they could do a little business,
either in selling their crockery or cheap cutlery,
baskets, and suchlike, or perhaps in fortune-telling,
and no doubt wherever they stopped the farm-yards
and poultry-yards in the neighbourhood were none
the better for it. At such times Duke and Pamela
were always hidden away deep in the recesses of one
of the waggons, so there was nothing they dreaded
more than when they saw signs of making a halt.
It was wretched to be huddled for hours together
in a dark corner among all sorts of dirty packages,
while the other children were allowed to run about
the village street picking up any odd pence they
could by playing tricks or selling little trifles out of
the general repository. And the brother and sister
were not at all consoled by being told that before
long they should be dressed up in beautiful gold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>and silver clothes&mdash;"like a real prince and princess,"
said Mick, once when he was in a good humour&mdash;and
taught to dance like fairies. For Tim's words
had explained to them the meaning of these fine
promises, and, though they said nothing, the little
pair were far less babyish and foolish in some ways
than the gipsies, who judged them by their delicate
appearance and small stature, had any idea of. But
still they were very young, and there is no telling
how soon they would have begun to get accustomed to
their strange life,&mdash;how soon even the remembrance of
Grandpapa and Grandmamma and their pretty peaceful
home, of Toby and Miss Mitten, of the garden
and their little white beds, of Nurse and Biddy and
Dymock, and all that had hitherto made up their
world,&mdash;would have begun to grow dim and hazy, and
at last seem only a dream, of which Mick, and the
Missus and Diana, and the others, and the green lanes,
with the waggons ever creeping along, and the coarse
food and coarser talking and laughing and scolding,
were the reality, had it not been for some fortunate
events which opened out to them the hope of escape
before they had learnt to forget they were in prison.</p>

<p>Tim was a great favourite in the gipsy camp.
He was not one of them, but he did not seem to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>remember any other life; in any case he never
spoke of it, and he was so much better tempered
and obliging than the cruel, quarrelsome gipsy boys,
that it was always to him that ran the two or three
tiny black-eyed children when their mothers had
cuffed them out of the way; it was always he who
had a kind word or a pat on the head for the two
half-starved curs that slunk along beside or under
the carts. There was no mystery about his life&mdash;he
was not a stolen child, and he could faintly
remember the little cottage where he had lived with
his mother before she died, leaving him perfectly
friendless and penniless, so that he was glad to pick
up an odd sixpence, or even less, wherever he could,
till one day he fell in with Mick, who offered him
his food and the chance of more by degrees, as he
wanted a sharp lad to help him in his various
trades&mdash;of pedlar, tinker, basket-maker, wicker-chair
mender, etc., not to speak of poultry-stealing, orchard-robbing,
and even child-thieving when he got a
chance that seemed likely to be profitable.</p>

<p>Poor little Tim&mdash;he had learnt very scanty
good in his short life! His mother, bowed down
with care and sorrow&mdash;for her husband, a thatcher
by trade, had been killed by an accident, leaving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>her with the boy of three years old and two
delicate babies, who both died&mdash;had barely managed
to keep herself and him alive by working in the
fields, and she used to come home at night so tired
out that she could scarcely speak to the child, much
less teach him as she would have liked to do. Still
on Sundays she always, till her last illness, managed
to take him to church, and in her simple way tried
to explain to him something of what he then heard.
But he was only eight years old when she died,
and, though he had not forgotten <i>her</i>, the memory
of her words had grown confused and misty. For,
in the four years since then, he had had no companions
but tramps and gipsies&mdash;till the day when
Duke and Pamela were decoyed away by Mick, he
had never exchanged more than a passing word or
two with any one of a better class. And somehow
the sight of their sweet innocent faces, the sound of
their gentle little voices had at once gained his
heart. Never had he thought so much of his mother,
of his tiny brother and sister, who, he fancied, would
have been about the size of the little strangers, as
since he had been with them. And when he saw
them looking shocked and frightened at the rough
words and tones of the gipsies,&mdash;when Pamela burst
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>out sobbing to see how dirty her face and hands
were, and Duke grew scarlet with fury at the boys
for throwing stones at the poor dogs,&mdash;most of all,
perhaps, when the two little creatures knelt together
in a corner of the van to say their prayers night
and morning&mdash;prayers which now always ended in a
sobbing entreaty "to be taken home again to dear
Grandpapa and Grandmamma,"&mdash;a strange feeling
rose in Tim's throat and seemed as if it would choke
him. And he lay awake night after night trying
to recall what his mother had taught him, wishing
he knew what it meant to be "good," wondering if
the Grandpapa and Grandmamma of whom the
children so constantly spoke would perhaps take
pity on him and put him in the way of a better
sort of life, if he could succeed in helping the little
master and missy to escape from the gipsies and
get safe back to their own home.</p>

<p>For every day, now that he had seen more of
the children, he understood better how dreadful it
would be for them if wicked Mick's intentions were
to succeed. But hitherto no opportunity of running
away had offered&mdash;the children were far too closely
watched. And Tim dared not take any one, not
even Diana, into his confidence!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>The chance for which Tim was hoping seemed slow
of coming. He was always on the look-out for it;
and, indeed, had he not been so Duke would have
kept him up to his promise, for whenever he saw
Tim alone for a moment he was sure to whisper to
him, "How soon do you think us can run away?"
And it was now the seventh day since the children
had been carried off!</p>

<p>Pamela's foot was almost well. She could walk
and even run without it hurting her. Diana had
bound it up carefully, after putting on some ointment
which certainly healed it very quickly. For,
with all their ignorance and brutality, the gipsies
were really clever in some ways. They had knowledge
of herbs which had been handed down to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>them by their ancestors, and their fingers were skilful
and nimble. And for their own sakes Mick and the
Missus were anxious that their two pretty prisoners
should not fall ill. So that, though dirty and uncared-for
as far as appearance went, the little pair had
not really suffered in health by their misfortunes.</p>

<p>It was partly, perhaps, owing to their innocent
hopefulness, which kept up their spirits when, had
they been wiser and older, they would have lost
heart and grown ill with fear and anxiety.</p>

<p>They were now far enough from Sandlingham
for Mick to feel pretty sure they would not be
tracked. The actual distance they had travelled
was not great, but a few miles in those days were
really more than a hundred at the present time.
For there were, of course, no railways; in many
parts of the country the cross-roads were so bad
that it was necessary and really quicker to make
long rounds rather than leave "the king's highway."
And&mdash;still more important, perhaps, in such a case&mdash;there
were no telegraphs! No possibility for poor
Grandpapa and Grandmamma&mdash;as there would be
nowadays, <i>could</i> such a thing happen as the theft of
little children&mdash;to send word in the space of an hour
or two to the police all over the country. Indeed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>compared with what it is in our times, the police
hardly existed.</p>

<p>And everything was in the gipsies' favour. No
one had seen them in the neighbourhood of Arbitt
Lodge. They had not been on the Sandlingham
high-road before meeting the children, and had
avoided it on purpose after that. So, among the
many explanations that were offered to the poor
old gentleman and lady of their grandchildren's
disappearance, though "stolen by gipsies" was suggested,
it was not seriously taken up.</p>

<p>"There have been no gipsies about here for months
past," said Grandpapa. "Besides, the children were
in our own grounds&mdash;gipsies could not have got in
without being seen&mdash;it is not as if they had been
straying about the lanes."</p>

<p>Everything that could be done had been done.
All the ponds in the neighbourhood had been dragged;
the only dangerous place anywhere near&mdash;a sort of
overhanging cliff over some unused quarries&mdash;had been
at once visited; the quarries themselves searched in
every corner&mdash;even though they were very meek-and-mild,
inoffensive quarries, where it would have been
difficult to hide even a little dog like Toby. And
all, as we of course know, had been in vain! There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>really seemed by the end of this same seventh day
<i>nothing</i> left to do. And Grandpapa sat with bowed
gray head, his newspaper unopened on the table
beside him, broken down, brave old soldier though
he was,&mdash;utterly broken down by this terrible blow.
While Grandmamma slowly drew her arm-chair a
little nearer than usual to the fire, for grief makes
people&mdash;old people especially&mdash;chilly. All her
briskness and energy were gone; her sweet old face
was white and drawn, with no pretty pink flush in
the cheeks now; her bright eyes were dimmed and
paled by the tears they had shed, till now even the
power of weeping seemed exhausted.</p>

<p>"I never thought&mdash;no, through all I never
thought," she murmured to herself, so low that even
if Grandpapa had been much sharper of hearing than
he was her words could not have reached him,&mdash;"I
never thought that a day would come when I should
thank the Lord that my Marmaduke&mdash;yes, and poor
little Lavinia too&mdash;had not lived to see their
darlings the pretty creatures they had become!
Yet now I am thankful&mdash;thankful for them to have
been spared this anguish. Though, again, if they had
been alive and well and able to take care of Duke
and Pam, perhaps it would never have happened."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>And once more&mdash;for the hundredth time, I daresay&mdash;poor
Grandmamma began torturing herself by
wondering in what she had erred&mdash;how could she
have taken better care of the children?&mdash;was it her
fault or Grandpapa's, or Nurse's, or Biddy's, or anybody's?
There had been <i>something</i> the matter with
Duke and Pam that last morning; they had had
something on their little minds. She had thought
so at the time, and now she was more than ever
sure of it. What could it have been?</p>

<p>"I thought it best not to force their confidence,
babies though they are," she reflected. "But perhaps
if I had persuaded them very tenderly, they would
have told me. Was I too severe and strict with
them, the darlings? I meant to act for the best,
but I am a foolish old woman&mdash;if only the punishment
of my mistakes could fall on me alone! Ah
dear, ah dear!&mdash;it would have been hard to lose
them by death, but in that case I should have felt
that they were going to their father and mother;
while <i>now</i>&mdash;it is awful to picture where they may
be, or what may have become of them! Oh Toby,
is it you, you poor little dog?" for just at this
moment Toby rubbed himself against her foot, looking
up in her face with a sad wistful expression
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>in his bright eyes. "Oh Toby, Toby," said Grandmamma,
"I wonder if you could tell us anything to
clear up this dreadful mystery if you could talk."</p>

<p>But Toby only wagged his tail&mdash;he was very
sad too, but he had far too much self-respect <i>not</i> to
wag his tail when he was kindly spoken to, however
depressed he might be feeling&mdash;and looked up again,
blinking his eyes behind their shaggy veil.</p>

<p>"Oh Toby," said poor Grandmamma again, as if
she really did not know what else to say.</p>

<p>And Grandpapa, half ashamed of his own
prostration, roused himself to try to say a cheering
word or two.</p>

<p>"We must hope still, my love," he said. "To-morrow
may bring news from the Central London
Police Office, where the Sandlingham overseer has
written to. He bade us keep up hope for a few
days yet, we must remember."</p>

<p>"Only for a few days more," repeated Grandmamma.
"And if those days bring nothing, what
<i>are</i> we to think&mdash;what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Upon my soul," said Grandpapa, "I do <i>not</i>
know;" and with a heavy sigh he turned away
again, glancing at the newspaper as if half inclined
to open it, but without the heart to do so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "if by any possibility they
had fallen into kind hands, and it had occurred to
any one to advertise about them, we should have
known it before this. The police are all on the alert
by now. If dishonest people have carried them off
for the sake of a reward, they will find means of
claiming it before long. The head-man at Sandlingham
does not advise our offering a reward as
yet. He says it might lead to more delay if they
are in dishonest hands. Their captors would wait
to see if more would not be offered&mdash;better let them
make the first move, he says."</p>

<p>"To think of putting a price on the darlings, as
if they were little strayed dogs!" exclaimed Grandmamma,
lifting her hands.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the door opened, and
Dymock came in. Grandmamma raised her face
quickly, with a look of expectation&mdash;the door never
opened in those sad days without her heart beating
faster with the hope of possible tidings&mdash;but it as
quickly faded again. Dymock had just the same
melancholy expression; he still walked on tiptoe,
and spoke in a muffled voice, as if he were entering
a sick-room. This was his way of showing his
sympathy, which really was most deep and sincere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
But somehow it provoked Grandmamma, who was,
it must be confessed, <i>rather</i> a quick-tempered old
lady at all times, and at present her nerves were of
course unusually irritated.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, Dymock?" she said testily.
"I wish you would not go about like a mute at a
funeral. You make me think I don't know what."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, ma'am, I'm sure," said Dymock
humbly, but still in the same subdued way. He
would not have taken offence just now at any
remark of Grandmamma's; but he could not help
speaking to her with a sort of respectful indulgence,
as much as to say, "I know she can't help it, poor
old lady," which Grandmamma found exceedingly
aggravating. "Beg pardon. But it's Mrs. Twiss.
If she could see you for a moment, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Old Barbara!" exclaimed Grandmamma. "Is
it possible that she&mdash;she is so shrewd and sensible&mdash;can
she have heard anything do you think,
Dymock?"</p>

<p>But Dymock shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p>"No, no, ma'am. It's not that. I'm very sorry
if by my manner I raised any false hopes."</p>

<p>"That you certainly did not, my good Dymock,"
said the old lady grimly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"But&mdash;would you see Mrs. Twiss, ma'am?
She's going from home I believe."</p>

<p>"Going from home&mdash;she who never leaves her
own cottage! Yes, I will see her," and in another
moment the neat old woman was making her curtsey
at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in, Barbara," said Grandmamma.
"And so you are off somewhere? How is that?
Ah, if I were as strong and well as you, I think I
would be tempted to set off on my travels to look
for my lost darlings. It is the staying here waiting
and doing nothing that is so dreadful, my good friend."</p>

<p>And Grandmamma's voice quavered with the
last words. It was not the first time she had seen
Barbara since the children's disappearance, for they
were old friends, and the cake woman had hurried
up to Arbitt Lodge at once on hearing of the sad
trouble that had befallen its inmates, to express her
concern and see if maybe she could be of any use.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, ma'am. I can well understand
it," she said. "How you bear up as you do is just
wonderful. I'm sure I can't get it out of my mind
for a moment. I keep seeing them as they passed
by that last afternoon. Nurse was a bit vexed
with them&mdash;missy's frock was torn and&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Grandmamma&mdash;Grandpapa
seeing her occupied had at last made up his mind
to open his newspaper&mdash;"Yes, I was thinking of
that. They told us about it, and they asked what
it meant to be 'a great charge;' they had heard
Nurse say that to you. She is a good woman, I
feel sure, Barbara, but perhaps she is a little too
strict. I have got it so on my mind that they had
some little trouble they did not like to tell about,
and that that, somehow, has had to do with it all."</p>

<p>"You don't mean, ma'am, that such tiny trots
as that would have run away on purpose?" said
Barbara in surprise. "Oh no, they'd never have
done that."</p>

<p>"No, I do not mean that exactly," said Grandmamma.
"I do not think I know rightly what I
mean. Dear, dear, I wish Dymock would keep
Toby away," she added. "You don't know how he
startles me&mdash;every time he comes close to me I
fancy somehow it is the children," and Grandmamma
looked so uneasy and nervous that Barbara quietly
took up the little dog and put him out of the room.
"And, Barbara, you had no reason for coming to see
me? Except, of course&mdash;I was forgetting&mdash;that
you are going away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only for a few days, ma'am," Barbara replied.
"I had a letter from my niece&mdash;leastways from her
husband&mdash;the niece who lives over near Monkhaven&mdash;yesterday.
She's been very ill, ma'am,&mdash;very ill
indeed, and though she's getting better it would be
a great comfort to her to see me, and maybe spirit
her up a bit to get well quicker. So I'm just
setting off&mdash;I've locked up my cottage and left the
key next door. But I couldn't start without looking
in again to see if maybe you had any news."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;nothing," replied Grandmamma. "And
I feel as if I couldn't bear much more. I am
breaking up, Barbara; a few days more will see
the last of me, my old friend, if they bring no
tidings."</p>

<p>Barbara's eyes filled with tears, but she said
nothing.&mdash;She had exhausted all her attempts at
comfort, all her "perhaps"'s, and "maybe"'s as to
what had become of the children; and though she
was a very cheerful and hopeful old woman, she
was also very sympathising, and it made her dreadfully
sad to see Grandmamma so changed and cast
down.</p>

<p>"It goes to my heart, ma'am, to see you so," she
got out at last. "I know there's nothing I can do,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>but all the same I wish I weren't going away just
now, though the few days will soon be past."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grandmamma, "they will certainly;
and yet even two days seem an eternity just now.
You see how foolish and weak I am growing,
Barbara. I want every day to be over, and yet I
cannot bear to have the days pass and to say to
myself that the chances of any tidings are lessening
and lessening. Soon it will be two weeks&mdash;it is
already eight days. When it was only two days it
did not seem so hopeless. But I must not keep you,
Barbara. How do you mean to get to Monkhaven?"</p>

<p>"Farmer Carson is to give me a lift as far as
Brigslade, and then I can walk the rest," said the
sturdy old woman, "so good-day to you, ma'am, and,
oh deary me, but I do hope there may be better
news to hear when I come back on Friday," and
with a cordial shake of the hand from Grandmamma,
Barbara turned to go. But just then
there came at the door a whining and scratching
which made the old lady give a sigh of impatience.</p>

<p>"It is the dog again," she said. "He is so
restless there is no keeping him quiet, and, though
I am very fond of him, I really cannot bear the
sight of him just now. I do wish he were away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandmamma spoke so weariedly and seemed so
nervous that Barbara felt more sorry for her than
ever. Suddenly an idea struck her.</p>

<p>"Would you let me take him with me, ma'am?"
she said. "He knows me so well that I should
have no trouble with him, and he'd be nice company
on the walk from Brigslade."</p>

<p>Grandmamma hesitated, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, take him, Barbara," she said. "He will
be much happier with you, poor little dog. And
till I have my darlings again,&mdash;and will that ever
be, Barbara?&mdash;I really cannot bear to see or hear
him. Yes, take him with you, poor little dog; and&mdash;and&mdash;keep
him as long as you like&mdash;unless&mdash;unless
there <i>do</i> come good news."</p>

<p>And thus it came to pass that Toby set out on
his travels with Barbara Twiss, while poor Grandmamma
shrank down again into her arm-chair by
the fire, and Grandpapa tried to imagine he was
reading his newspaper as usual.</p>

<p>What did poor Toby think of it all? His ideas
had been very confused for some days, poor little
dog. He could not make out what had become
of the children. He sniffed about everywhere, once
or twice barking with sudden delight when, coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>upon some relic of his little master or mistress,
such as Duke's old garden hat or Pamela's tiny
parasol, he imagined for a moment or two that he
had found them, only to creep off again with his
tail between his legs in renewed disappointment
when he discovered his mistake, all of which, it is
easy to understand, had been very trying to poor
Grandmamma, and no doubt to Toby himself. He
did not understand what he was scolded for when
he certainly meant no harm; he could not make
out why Dymock gave him little shoves out of the
way and Biddy bade him sharply be quiet when he,
naturally enough, yelped at this inconsiderate treatment.
And worst of all, when, after the most
mature reflection, he took up his quarters on one
of the two little white beds in the night nursery,
deciding that there, sooner or later, his friends <i>must</i>
return, was it not <i>too</i> bad that Nurse, hobbling about
again after her rheumatic attack, which she had
made much worse by fretting,&mdash;was it not <i>too</i> bad
that she should unceremoniously dislodge him with
never a "by your leave," or "with your leave"?</p>

<p>Toby shook himself and walked off in disgust.</p>

<p>"You very silly and stupid old woman," he said
to her in his own mind, "if you only had the sense
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>to understand <i>my</i> language, you would see that the
only rational thing to do is to wait for Duke and
Pam in a place where they are sure to come. And
that is their beds. I have thought it out, I assure
you. But there is no use trying to put reasonable
ideas into human beings' heads. I might bark
myself black in the face before any one could take
in what I mean."</p>

<p>It was just after this that he had wandered away
downstairs in search of a quiet corner; and on first
entering the parlour Grandmamma spoke to him so
kindly that he began to think of bestowing his
company upon her for the rest of the day, especially
as she was always installed near a good fire. Toby
dearly loved a fire; even on a hot summer's day the
kitchen fire had great attractions for him. But
when Mrs. Twiss came in, and he, as was his duty
and business of course, went to the door to see who
it was, that officious Dymock shut him out again,
and actually when he whined and scratched in the
politest manner to be let in Grandmamma spoke
crossly to him.</p>

<p>"Et tu, Brute!" thought Toby to himself. What
was coming over the world?</p>

<p>On the whole he was not sorry to find himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>trotting down the lane beside Barbara, whom he
had a sincere regard for. She spoke to him with
proper respect; she was not given to shoves like
Dymock, or sharp expressions like Nurse and Biddy,
and when she called him to follow her, Toby
willingly followed.</p>

<p>"You're to come along with me, poor doggie,"
she said. "You're only a worry to the good lady
at present, and I'm pleased to have your company.
Besides, who knows, you're a sharp dog, Toby, and
you and I will keep our eyes and ears open, and you
your nose as well, for that's a gift the more, you
have, you doggies, nor us."</p>

<p>And so saying Barbara and her companion made
their way to the cross-roads, a point well known in the
country-side. For there a great finger-post served
the double purpose of informing the traveller in four
directions and of frightening many a country lad or
lassie of a moonlight night, when it stood gaunt and
staring like a gigantic skeleton, as everybody knows
the meeting of cross-roads is at no time a canny spot.</p>

<p>Here Farmer Carson had promised to take up
Barbara, for his home lay a mile or two out of the
village, all of which she kindly explained to her
little companion as they went along. She had a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>great habit of talking to herself, and she was so
much alone that it was quite a treat to have "some
one" to talk to, as she also informed Toby. He
looked up at her with his bright eyes, from time to
time wagging his tail, "for all the world like a
Christian," thought Barbara, but nevertheless I am
afraid he did not take in her information as fully as
appeared. For when, after they had sat waiting
for him for some minutes, the worthy farmer drove
up with a cheery "Good morning, Mrs. Twiss," Toby
had the impertinence to bark furiously at him and
his most respectable old mare, as if they had not
quite as good a right as he to the king's highway!</p>

<p>This, of course caught the farmer's attention.</p>

<p>"That's a knowing little chap you've got with
you, neighbour Twiss," he said; "he favours the one
at the Lodge, does he not?"</p>

<p>This naturally led to Barbara's explaining that
he was the one at the Lodge in person, and then
she and her friend beguiled the way by talking
over the sad and mysterious disappearance of the
children.</p>

<p>It was very sad, and very strange, the farmer
agreed. Then he scratched his head with the hand
that was not occupied with the reins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've thought a deal about it," he said, "and
I've come to think it's&mdash;as likely as not&mdash;gipsies
after all."</p>

<p>Barbara started.</p>

<p>"But there's been none about," she said, "not
for ever so long. The General"&mdash;the General was
Grandpapa&mdash;"thought of that at the very first and
asked all about. But there'd been none heard of,
and heard of they always are pretty quick, and none
so pleasantly, as you should know well, Mr. Carson."</p>

<p>"I do so, I do so," he agreed, nodding his head.
"But they're a cunning lot. If they'd any reason
for getting quick out of the way, they'd do it. All
I can tell you is this, and I only heard it last night:
one o' my men coming home what he calls a short-cut
way saw traces of a fire down by Black Marsh;
and he's certain sure the marks weren't there the
day before the children disappeared. That was the
last time he'd passed that way."</p>

<p>"And that's more nor a week past," said Barbara.
"If it should be so,&mdash;if the gipsies have really got
them,&mdash;they may be a long way off by now."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the farmer; "that's the worst of
it. And no telling what road they've gone, neither.
No; I'm sadly afraid if it's been gipsies there's not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>much chance of seeing them again, unless they're
tempted by the rewards. Pretty little creatures
like that they can always make a good deal by,
for those shows as goes about. And they're such
babies&mdash;only four or five years old, aren't they?
They'll soon forget where they come from and all."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Barbara, "they're small for their
age, for they're six past. But they're not dull; no,
indeed, they're very quick children. They'd not
forget in a hurry."</p>

<p>Then she grew very silent. It made her terribly
sad to think of the two tender little creatures in
such hands; suddenly Toby, who had been quietly
reposing at her feet, jumped up and gave a short
sharp bark.</p>

<p>"What is it, Toby?" said Barbara, patting him.</p>

<p>Toby grunted a little, and then lay down again.
The reason of his barking was that he had just discovered
why old Barbara had brought him away on
this journey. It was that <i>he</i> was to find the children&mdash;he
quite understood all about it now, and wished
to say so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>For some days the gipsy caravan had been making
its way along a very lonely road; they had come
across no towns at all and no large villages. They
got over more ground now, for there was less
temptation to linger. The truth was that Mick
and the other heads of the party had in some way
got news that the great fair to which they were
bound was to begin sooner than they expected, and
unless they hurried on they might not be there in
time to take up a good position among the many
strays and waifs of their kind always to be found
at such places. There were ever so many ways in
which they expected to turn a number of honest
or dishonest "pennies" at this same fair. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>one of their regular harvest times. Mick and his
friends always managed to do something in the
way of horse-dealing on such occasions, and Diana,
who was the best-looking of the younger gipsy-women,
was thoroughly up to all the tricks of
fortune-telling. Her cold haughty manners had
often more success than the wheedling flatteries of
the others. She <i>looked</i> as if she were quite above
trickery of any kind, and no doubt the things she
told were not altogether nonsense or falsehood. For
she had learned to be wonderfully quick in reading
the characters of those who applied to her, even in
divining the thoughts and anxieties in their minds.
And besides these resources the gipsies had a good
show of baskets and brooms of their own manufacture
to dispose of; added to which this year a
hard bargain was to be driven with Signor Fribusco,
the owner of the travelling circus, for the "two
lovely orphans," whose description had already been
given to him by some of the gipsy's confidantes, to
whom Mick had sent word, knowing them to be
in the Signor's neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Some of this Tim had found out by dint of
listening to bits of conversation when he was supposed
to be asleep. He grew more and more afraid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>as the days passed on and no chance of escape
offered, for various things began to make him fear
they were not very far from the town they were
bound to. For one thing Mick's wife and Diana
began to pay more attention to the two children's
appearance. Their fair hair was brushed and
combed every day, and their delicate skin was
carefully washed with something that restored it
almost to its natural colour; all of which had an
ominous meaning for Tim.</p>

<p>"Diana is very kind now," said Pamela, one day
when she and Duke had been allowed for once to
run about a little with the other children. There
certainly seemed small risk in their doing so, for
the gipsies had encamped for the night on a desolate
moor, where no human habitations of any kind were
in sight, no passers-by to be feared.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Duke, who had hold of Tim's other
hand; "she makes us nice and clean and tidy."</p>

<p>"And she's making a gown for me," said Pamela.
"It's made of my own white gown, but she's sewing
rows of red and blue and gold round it. And she
says if Duke is good she's going to make him a red
jacket. Isn't it kind of her? Do you know, Tim,"
she went on in a lower tone, "us has been thinking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>that perhaps they're meaning to take us home soon,
and that they want us to look very nice. Do you
think it's that, Tim? I'm sure Grandpapa and
Grandmamma would be so pleased they'd give them
lots of money if they took us back."</p>

<p>"I'm afeared it's not taking you home they're
thinking of, missie," said Tim grimly.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you help us to run away,
Tim?" said Duke impatiently. "I've asked you
and asked you. I'm sure us might run away <i>now</i>&mdash;there's
nobody looking after us."</p>

<p>"And where would we run to?" said Tim.
"There's not a mortal house nor a tree even to be
seen. Run away, indeed! We'd be cotched&mdash;cotched
afore we'd run half a mile. And yet it's
the very first time you've bin let run about a little.
I'm ready enough to run away, but no good running
away to be cotched again&mdash;it 'ud be worser nor ever."</p>

<p>"Then is us never to run away? Is us never
to see Grandpapa, and Grandmamma, and Dymock,
and Biddy, and Nurse, and Toby&mdash;oh, dear Toby!&mdash;and
the garden, and the nursery, and our little beds,
again?" said both children, speaking together and
helping each other with the list of their lost blessings,
and in the end bursting into tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Tim looked at them ruefully.</p>

<p>"Don't 'ee now, don't 'ee, master and missy," he
said anxiously. "They'll see you've been crying,
and they'll not let you out any more."</p>

<p>Duke and Pamela tried to choke down their sobs.</p>

<p>"Will you try to help us to run away, then, if
us is very good&mdash;Tim, dear Tim, oh do," they said
piteously. And Tim tried to soothe them with
kind words and promises to do his best.</p>

<p>Poor fellow, he was only too ready to run away
for his own sake as well as theirs. The feelings
which had been stirred and reawakened by the
children's companionship had not slumbered again;
on the contrary, they seemed to gain strength every
day. Every day he felt more and more loathing
for his present life; every night when he tumbled
into the ragged heap which was called his bed he
said to himself more strongly that he <i>must</i> get away&mdash;he
could not bear to think that his mother,
looking down on him from the heaven in which she
had taught him to believe, could see him the dirty
careless gipsy boy he had become. It was wonderful
how her words came back to him now&mdash;how every
time he could manage to get a little talk with his
new friends their gentle voices and pretty ways
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>seemed to revive old memories that he had not
known were there. And the thought of rescuing
them,&mdash;of succeeding in taking them safe back to
their own home,&mdash;opened a new door for him.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Tim to himself, "the old gentleman
and lady'd take me on as a stable-boy or such like
if the little master and missie'd speak a word for
me, as I'm sure they would. And I'm right down
sure I'd try to do my best&mdash;anything to get away
from this life."</p>

<p>Of course he could have got away by himself
at any time much more easily than with the children.
But till now, as he had told them, he had not cared
to try it, for where had he to run to? And, besides,
it was only since Duke and Pamela had been with
the gipsies that the wish to return to a better kind
of life had grown so very strong.</p>

<p>He sighed heavily as he stood on the desolate
moor with his two little companions, for he felt
what he would not say to them, how terribly difficult
their escape would be.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pamela tugged at his arm.</p>

<p>"What is that shining down there, Tim?" she
said, pointing over the moor, which sloped downwards
at one side. "Is it a river?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Tim looked where she directed, and his face
brightened a little.</p>

<p>"'Tis the canal, missie," he said. "It comes past
Monkhaven, and goes&mdash;I don't rightly know where
to. Maybe to that place we're going to, where the
fair's to be. I once went a bit of a way on a canal&mdash;that
was afore I was with Mick and his lot.
There was a boy and his mother as was very good
to me. I wish I could see them again, I do."</p>

<p>"But what <i>is</i> a canal, Tim," said Pamela. "Us
has never seen one, and that down there looks like
a silver thread&mdash;it shines like water."</p>

<p>"So it is water, missie&mdash;a canal's a sort of a
river, only it goes along always quite straight. It
doesn't go bending in and out like a real river,
sometimes bigger and sometimes littler like."</p>

<p>"And how did you go on it," asked Duke.
"And the boy and his mother? You couldn't walk
on it if it was water&mdash;nobody can except Jesus in
the big Bible at home. <i>He</i> walked on the top of
the water."</p>

<p>"Did he really?" said Tim, opening his eyes.
"I've heerd tell on him. He was very good to poor
folk and such like, wasn't he? Mother telled me
about him, tho' I thought I'd forgotten all she'd told
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>me. But I remember the name now as you says
it. And what did he walk on the top o' the water
for, master?"</p>

<p>Duke looked a little puzzled.</p>

<p>"I don't quite remember, but I think it was to
help some poor men when the sea was rough."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Pamela; "<i>that</i> was the time he
felled asleep, and they woked him up to make the
storm go away."</p>

<p>"I'm sure there was a storm the time he was
walking on the water, too," said Duke; "there's the
picture of it. When us goes in, sister, us'll get
Grandmamma's picture-Bible and look"&mdash;but suddenly
his voice fell, his eager expression faded. In
the interest of the little discussion he had forgotten
where they were, how far away from Grandmamma
and her picture-Bible, how uncertain if ever they
should see her or it again! Pamela understood.</p>

<p>"I wish Jesus would come and help us now,"
she said softly. "I'm sure us needs him quite as
much as those men he was so kind to. Tell us
about the canal, Tim."</p>

<p>"It's boats," replied Tim. "Long boats made
just the right shape. And they've got rooms in
them&mdash;quite tidy-like. The one that boy lived in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>along o' his mother was as nice as&mdash;as nice as nice.
And then they go a-sailin' along&mdash;right from one
end of the canal to the other."</p>

<p>"What for&mdash;just because they like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. They've all sorts of things they take
about from one place to another&mdash;wood often and
coal. But that wasn't a coal boat&mdash;it was nice and
clean that one. And there's hosses as walks along
the side of the canals, pullin' of the boats with
ropes. It's a pleasant life enough, to my thinking&mdash;that's
to say when they're tidy, civil-like folk.
Some of them's awful rough&mdash;as rough as Mick and
the Missus and all o' <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>Duke and Pamela listened with the greatest
interest. They quite forgot to cry any more about
their home in listening to what Tim told them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tim," said Pamela, "I'll tell you what
<i>would</i> be nice. If us and you could get one of
those boats, and a horse to pull it, and go sailing
away till we got home to Grandpapa and Grandmamma.
That would be nice, wouldn't it, Tim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, missie," said Tim. "But is there canals
near your place?"</p>

<p>Pamela's face fell.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never thought of that," she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>said. "But I daresay there's one that goes to not
far off from there. And Mick would never catch
us then, would he, Tim? We'd go so fast, wouldn't
we?"</p>

<p>"They don't go that fast&mdash;not canal boats,"
replied Tim. "Still I don't think as Mick'd ever
think of looking for us there. That'd be the best
of it."</p>

<p>But just then the rough voice of Mick himself
was heard calling to them to come back; for they
had wandered to some little distance from the other
children, who were quarrelling and shouting near
the vans.</p>

<p>"Come back you brats, will ye?" he roared. And
the poor little things, like frightened sheep, followed
by Tim, hurried back. Pamela shuddered at the
sound of their jailor's voice in a way the boy could
not bear to see. Mick had never yet actually
struck her or her brother so as to hurt them; but
Tim well knew that any day it might come to
that.</p>

<p>"And a blow from his heavy hand&mdash;such a blow
as he's given me many a time when he's been tipsy&mdash;would
go near to killing them tender sort o' fairy-like
critturs," said the boy to himself, shuddering in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>his turn. "He's been extra sober for a good bit,
but onst he gets to the fair there's no saying."</p>

<p>And over and over again, as he was falling asleep,
he asked himself what could be done,&mdash;how it would
be possible to make their escape? Somehow the
sight of the canal had roused a little hope in him,
though he did not yet see how it could be turned
to purpose.</p>

<p>"If we keeps it in sight, I'll see if I can't get
near hand it some day and have a look at the
boats, if there's any passing. Maybe there'd be
some coming from where the fair is. And if there
was any folk like them as was so good to me that
time, they'd be the right sort for to help us."</p>

<p>And poor Tim had a most beautiful dream that
night. He thought he himself and Duke and
Pamela were sailing down a lovely stream in a
boat shining like silver, and with sails of white
striped with red and blue and gold, like the frock
Diana was trimming for Pamela. They went so
fast it was more like flying than sailing, and all of
a sudden they met another boat in which were a
lady and gentleman, whom he somehow knew at
once were the Grandpapa and Grandmamma of the
children's talk, though they were dressed so grandly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>in crimson robes, and with golden crowns on their
heads like kings and queens, that he was frightened
to speak to them; for he had nothing on but his
ragged clothes. And just as Duke and Pamela
were rushing towards them with joy, and he was
turning away ashamed and miserable, wiping his
tears with his jacket sleeve, a soft voice called to
him not to be afraid but to come forward too. And
looking up he saw a figure hovering over him, all
white and shining like an angel. But when he
looked at the face&mdash;though it was so beautiful&mdash;he
knew he had seen it before. It was that of his poor
mother; he knew at once it was she, though in life
he could only remember her wan and worn and
often weeping.</p>

<p>"Take courage, my boy&mdash;a new life is beginning
for you. Have no fear."</p>

<p>And then, just as it seemed to him that little
Pamela turned round, holding out her hand to lead
him forward, he woke!</p>

<p>But his dream left a hopeful feeling in his heart.
It was still very early morning and all his companions
were asleep. Tim got up and very quietly
crept out of the sort of one-sided tent, made by
drawing a sail-cloth downwards from the top of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>the van, where he and the other boys slept. He
walked a little way over the rough moor, for there
was no road, scarcely even a track, and looked down
to where, in the clear thin morning light, the canal
lay glittering below. Then he gazed over the waste
in front. Which way would they be going? Would
they skirt the canal more closely or branch off and
strike away from it? Tim could not tell. But he resolved
to keep his eyes and ears open and to find out.</p>

<p>All that day the gipsy vans jolted along the
rough cart-track across the moor. They halted as
usual at mid-day&mdash;but Tim could not get to speak
to the twins at all. And then the caravan started
again and went rumbling on till much later than
usual, for, as Tim overheard from the gipsies' conversation,
they were eager now to get to Crookford,
where the fair was to be, as quickly as possible.
When they at last stopped for the night it was
almost dark; but the boy crept close up to the
entrance of the waggon where he knew the children
to be, and hid himself at the side, and, as he
expected, the two little figures came timidly forward.</p>

<p>"Diana," they said softly, and he heard the girl
answer not unkindly, but coldly, as was her way.</p>

<p>"Well, what now?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mayn't us come out a little bit, even if it is
dark? Us is so tired of being in here all day."</p>

<p>"And my head's aching," added Pamela.</p>

<p>Diana hesitated. A small fine rain&mdash;or perhaps
it was only mist&mdash;was beginning to fall; but in
spite of that she would probably have let them out
a little had not Mick just then come forward.</p>

<p>"They want out a bit," she said. "They're tired
like with being mewed up in there all day and
never a breath of air&mdash;no wonder," and she made
as if she were going to lift Pamela down the steps.</p>

<p>"Are you crazed, girl?" said the gipsy, pushing
her back. "To let them out now in the chill of
the evening, and it raining too&mdash;to have them catch
their deaths of cold just as I've some chance of making
up for all the trouble they've cost me. Fool
that I was to be bothered with them. But you're
not a-going to spoil all now&mdash;that I can tell ye."</p>

<p>Diana looked at him without speaking. She
was not at all in the habit of giving in to him, but
she knew that a quarrel terrified the children. She
felt too, as she lifted her dark face to the clouded
sky, that it was really raining, and she reflected that
there might be truth in what Mick said so rudely.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="four" id="four"></a><img src="./images/004.jpg" alt="&quot;THEY WANT OUT A BIT,&quot; SHE SAID." title="&quot;THEY WANT OUT A BIT,&quot; SHE SAID." /></div>

<div class='center'><small>"THEY WANT OUT A BIT," SHE SAID. "THEY'RE TIRED LIKE WITH BEING MEWED<br />
UP IN THERE ALL DAY AND NEVER A BREATH OF AIR&mdash;NO WONDER."</small>&mdash;p. <a href='#Page_132'>132</a>.</div>

<p>"I think it is too cold and damp for you," she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>said turning to the door where the two little white
faces were looking out piteously. "Never mind,"
she added in a lower tone, "I'll come back in a
minute, and we'll open the window to let some air
in, and then I'll sing you to sleep."</p>

<p>Tim could scarcely believe his ears to hear the
rough harsh Diana speaking so gently.</p>

<p>"If <i>she'd</i> help us," he thought to himself, "there'd
be some chance then."</p>

<p>But he remained quite still, crouching in the
shelter of the van&mdash;almost indeed under it&mdash;he was
so anxious to hear more of Mick's plans if he could,
for he noticed that the gipsy hung about while the
girl was speaking to the children, as if he had
something to say to her unheard by them.</p>

<p>They were so frightened of him that they drew
back into the dark recesses of the van, and when
they were no longer to be seen, Mick pulled Diana's
sleeve to attract her attention.</p>

<p>"Just you listen to me, girl, will ye?" he said.
"I'll stand none of your nonsense&mdash;thinking to
queen it over us all. Now just listen to me."</p>

<p>Diana shook his hand off her arm.</p>

<p>"I'll listen if you'll speak civil, Mick," she said.
"What is it you've got to say?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>She spoke quietly but sternly, and he seemed
frightened. He had evidently been drinking more
than of late, and Tim shuddered at the thought of
what might happen if he were to get into one of his
regular tipsy fits while the children were still there.</p>

<p>"It's along o' them childer," said Mick, though
less roughly now. "You're a-spoiling of them, and
I won't have it. To-morrow evening'll see us at
Crookford, and the day after they're to be took to
the Signor. Their looks'll please him&mdash;I'm not
afeard for that; but I've gave him to understand
that they're well broke in, and there'll be no
trouble in teaching them the tricks and singin' and
dancin' and all that. And he's to give me a good
sum down and a share of the profits. And if he's
not pleased and they're turned back on my hands&mdash;well,
it'll be <i>your</i> doing&mdash;that I can tell you, and
you shall pay for it. So there&mdash;you know my
mind."</p>

<p>He had worked himself up into rage and excitement
again while he spoke, but Diana did not seem
to care.</p>

<p>"What do you know of the man? will he be
good to them?" she said coolly.</p>

<p>Mick gave a sneering laugh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"He won't starve them nor beat them so as to
spoil their pretty looks," he said. "They'll have to
do what they're told, and learn quick what they've
got to learn. You don't suppose childer like that
'ull pay for their keep if they're to be made princes
and princesses of?"</p>

<p>"Then what did you steal them for? You do
nothing but grumble about them now you've got
them&mdash;why didn't you, any way, take them home
after a bit and get something for your pains?"</p>

<p>"I thought o' doing so at the first," said Mick
sulkily, as if forced to speak in spite of himself.
"But they're sharper nor I thought for. No knowing
what they'd ha' told. And when Johnny Vyse
came by and told o' the fair, and the Signor sure to
be ready to take 'em and pay straight for 'em, I
see'd no use in running my head into a noose by
taking 'em back and getting took myself for my
pains. I've had enough o' that sort o' thing, as you
might know."</p>

<p>"Let <i>me</i> take them home, then," said Diana
suddenly. "I'll manage so as no blame shall fall
on you&mdash;no one shall hear anything about you.
And for myself I don't care. I'd almost as lief be
in prison as not sometimes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Mick stared at her.</p>

<p>"Are ye a-going out of yer mind?" he said, "or
d'ye think I am? After all the trouble I've had
with the brats, is it likely I'll send 'em home and
lose all? It's too late now to try for a reward;
they're sharp enough to tell they could have been
took home long ago. But if the Signor isn't square
with me, I may make something that way too&mdash;I
can tell on <i>him</i> maybe. But I'll take care to get
my reward and be out o' the way first. I'm not
such a fool as you took me for after all, eh? And
if you see what's for your good you'll do your best
to help me, and you'll find I'll not forget you. One
way or another I'm pretty sure to make a tidy thing
of them."</p>

<p>Diana turned away, and for a moment or two
there was silence. Tim's heart beat so fast he
almost felt as if the gipsies would hear it. He
could not see Diana's face, but he trembled with fear
lest Mick's bribes should win her over. And when
her words came it seemed as if his fears were to be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> a sharp one, Mick, and no mistake,"
she said, with a strange hard laugh. The gipsy
was too muddled in his head to notice anything
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>peculiar in her tone, and he took her answer for a
consent.</p>

<p>"That's right. I thought ye'd hear reason," he
said. And then he lurched off to his own quarters.</p>

<p>Diana stood where she was for a moment.
Suddenly she raised her hands to her face, and Tim
fancied he heard a smothered sob. Without stopping
to think what he was risking, the boy crept out of
the shadow where he had been hidden, and caught
hold of her skirts just as she was turning to mount
into the van where the children were.</p>

<p>"Diana," he said breathlessly, "I've heard all
he said. You don't mean to take part with him,
do you? You'll never help to sell those pretty
babies like that? I'll do anything&mdash;anything you
tell me&mdash;if you'll join with me to get them sent
home."</p>

<p>In her turn Diana caught hold of him and held
him fast.</p>

<p>"Tim," she said, "you want to get off yourself,
and you'd do your best for them. I've seen it. But
alone you'd never manage it. I'll help you, Tim.
I won't have it on my conscience that I stood by
and saw those innocents sold to such a life. If it
had been to keep them a while longer with us, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>mightn't have done anything, not just yet, not till
I saw a chance. But whatever Mick and the others
say, I won't see them taken away unless it is to go
back to their own people."</p>

<p>"That's right, Diana," said Tim.</p>

<p>"And I'll help you. Keep your wits about you
and be ready when I give the sign. Now get out
of the way and take care. If Mick hadn't made
himself stupid lately he'd have seen you were
thinking of something. You mustn't say a word to
the children; leave them to me," and again squeezing
the boy's arm meaningly, she climbed up into
the waggon, where the two little prisoners, tired of
waiting for her, had fallen fast asleep.</p>

<p>Tim, for his part, tumbled into his so-called bed
that night, with a wonderfully lightened heart, and
his dreams were filled with the most joyous hopes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>NEW HOPES.</h3>

</table></div>


<p>It was a good thing Tim had some new ground of
hope, for otherwise the next day or two would have
sadly distressed him. He never once could get near
the children. And, what he found very strange,
Diana herself seemed to be doing her utmost to
keep him from them. Two or three times, especially
when Mick or the Missus happened to be near,
she roughly pushed him back when he was making
his way to the door of the van, where Duke and
his sister were. And at first the boy was not only
surprised, but rather offended.</p>

<p>"What for will you not let me play with them
a bit?" he said to her, half inclined to appeal to
Mick, who did not interfere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"They've no need of <i>you</i>&mdash;keep out of my way,"
Diana answered roughly, at which Mick and the
others laughed as if it was a very good joke, for
hitherto Diana had been always accused of "favouring"
the boy.</p>

<p>Tim looked up resentfully. He had it on his
tongue&mdash;for after all he was only a child&mdash;to say
something which might have done harm never to
be undone, for he could not understand Diana.
But something in her face, as she looked at him
steadily, stopped the words of reproach as they rose
to his lips.</p>

<p>"You'll make an end of them, you will, if you
keep them choked up in there all day," he said
sullenly. "Why can't you let 'em out for a bit of
a run with me, like you've done before?"</p>

<p>"I'll let them out when it suits me, and not
before. It's none of your business," she replied,
while adding in a lower tone that no one else could
overhear: "I'd never have thought you such a fool,
Tim;" and Tim, feeling rather small,&mdash;for he began
to understand her a little,&mdash;walked off.</p>

<p>All this was at what they called dinner-time,
when the vans generally halted for an hour or so
and hitherto&mdash;even when they were travelling too
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>quickly for the children to have walked beside for
a change, as they had sometimes done when going
slowly&mdash;Mick or Diana had always let them out at
this hour for a breath of fresh air. But to-day,
though it was beautifully fine and the sun was
shining most temptingly, poor Duke and Pamela
had to be content with the sight of it through the
tiny little window in the side of the van, which
Diana opened, and with such air as could get in by
the same means. It was hot and stuffy inside, and
their little heads ached with being jolted along, and
with having had no exercise such as they were
accustomed to. Still they did not look altogether
miserable or unhappy, as they tried to eat the
dinner the gipsy girl had brought them on a tin
plate, from the quickly-lighted fire by the hedge,
where the old hag who did the cooking for the
party had been stewing away at a mess in a great
pot. She ladled out the contents all round for the
others, but Diana helped herself. She picked out
the nicest bits she could see for the two little
prisoners, and stood by them for a minute or two
to see if they really were going to eat.</p>

<p>"I'll come back in a bit to see if it's all gone,"
she said, when she had seen them at work, "and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>remember what I said this morning. That'll help
to make you eat hearty."</p>

<p>"Her's very kind," said Duke; but as he spoke
he laid down the coarse two-pronged fork Diana
had given him to eat with, and seemed glad of an
excuse to rest in his labours for a while. "But I
can't eat this, can you, sister?"</p>

<p>Pamela looked up&mdash;she had got a small bone in
her fingers, at which she was trying to nibble.</p>

<p>"I'm pretending to be Toby eating a bone," she
said gravely. "Sometimes it makes it seem nicer."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't think so," said Duke. "It only makes
it worser to think of Toby," and his voice grew very
doleful, as if he were going to cry.</p>

<p>"Now don't, bruvver," said Pamela. "Let's
think of what Diana said."</p>

<p>"What was it?" said Duke. "Say it again."</p>

<p>"'Twas that, p'raps, if us was very good and did
just ezactly what her tells us, us'd go somewhere
soon, where us'd be <i>very</i> happy," said Pamela.
"Where do you fink it can be, Duke? Us mustn't
tell <i>nobody</i>, not even Tim; but I don't mind, for
Diana said she thought Tim'd go too. Do you
fink she meant" (and here poor little Pam, who had
learnt unnatural caution already, glanced round her&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>as
if any one could have been hidden in the
small space of the van!&mdash;and lowered her voice)&mdash;"that
she meant us was to go <i>home</i> again to dear
Grandmamma and Grandpapa?"</p>

<p>Duke shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "they'll never send us home
now. Mick'd be put in prison if he took us home.
I know that. I heard what they was saying about
it one day when they didn't know I was there.
And it's too far away&mdash;it's a dreadful way away.
We can never go home. I daresay Grandpapa and
Grandmamma and everybody's dead by now," concluded
Duke, who talked with a sort of reckless
composure sometimes, altogether too much for Pamela,
who burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Oh bruvver!" she cried between her sobs,
"don't talk like that. I <i>fink</i> God's too good to
have let dear Grandpapa and Grandmamma die.
And us has said our prayers such many many times
about going home. I'm sure Grandpapa would
never put Mick in prison if us asked him not, and
p'raps if Mick was sure of that he'd take us home.
Oh don't you fink us might go and ask him," and
she started up.</p>

<p>"Us can't promise it; Grandpapa'd <i>have</i> to do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>it. It'd be his <i>dooty</i>," said Duke sternly&mdash;his ideas
on all subjects were very grim at present&mdash;"he'd
have to stop Mick going and stealing away other
children like he did us. And Diana said us
mustn't speak to <i>nobody</i> about what she told us."</p>

<p>"I don't care about it if it isn't that us is going
home," said Pamela, crying quietly. "I don't care
about gold frocks like fairies and all that if dear
Grandmamma and Grandpapa can't see us."</p>

<p>Duke looked at her gloomily.</p>

<p>"P'raps Diana meant us'd soon be going to
heaven," he said at last. "I heard them saying
us'd 'not stand it long,' and I know that means
going to die."</p>

<p>"I don't care," sobbed Pamela again, "if Grandpapa
and Grandmamma are dead, heaven'd be the
best place for us to go to;" and regardless of all
Diana had said to her about trying to eat and to
keep up her spirits, the little girl let the tin plate,
with the greasy meat and gravy, slip off her knees
on to the floor, and, leaning her head on the hard
wooden bench, she went off in a fit of piteous and
hopeless sobbing. In a moment Duke's arms were
around her, and he was kissing and hugging and
doing his best to console her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear little sister," he cried, "don't be so <i>very</i>
unhappy. It was very naughty of me to say dear
Grandpapa and Grandmamma and everybody would
be dead."</p>

<p>"And Toby," interrupted Pamela. "Did you
mean Toby too?"</p>

<p>Duke considered.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I meant Toby. He must be
a good deal younger than Grandpapa and Grandmamma,
and I don't think he'd be <i>quite</i> so unhappy
about us as they'd be."</p>

<p>"If <i>I'd</i> been Toby I'd have come to look for
us," said Pamela, crying now less violently. "Us
could have wrote a letter and tied it to his collar,
and then Grandpapa could have come to look for
us. Toby can run so fast," and she was going on
to describe what she would have done in Toby's
place when the little door of the van opened and
Diana reappeared. Her face clouded as she looked
at the children.</p>

<p>"Crying again! Oh missie," she said reproachfully,
"that's not good of you. You'll cry yourself
ill, and then&mdash;&mdash;" Diana in turn looked round and
lowered her voice, "have you forgotten the secret
I told you? You'll never get away where you'd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>like to be if you make yourself ill. And scarce a
bite of dinner have you touched," she went on,
looking at the bits of meat reposing beside the
overturned plate.</p>

<p>Pamela lifted up her tear-swollen face and drew
herself out of Duke's arms, to fling herself into
Diana's.</p>

<p>"If us is going to die, it's no good eating," she said.</p>

<p>"Who said you was a-going to die?" exclaimed
the gipsy girl.</p>

<p>"Duke and I was talking, and us thought p'raps
heaven was the nice place you said us'd go to if
us was good," replied Pamela.</p>

<p>Diana gave a little laugh, half sad and half
bitter.</p>

<p>"It isn't here you'll learn much about going to
<i>that</i> place," she said. "But that wasn't what I
meant. Listen, master and missy; but, mind you,
never you say one word,&mdash;now hush and listen," and
in a very low voice she went on: "To-night we'll get
to a big town where there's a fair. Mick's got it all
settled to give you to a&mdash;a gentleman there, who'd
dress you up fine and teach you to sing and to dance."</p>

<p>"Would he be kind to us?" asked both children
eagerly. Diana shook her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe, and maybe not. That's just why I
cannot stand by and see you given to him," said
Diana, half as if speaking to herself. "It was a
bad day's work when he took them," she went on.
Then suddenly rousing herself: "Listen children,
again," she said. "If that man as I'm speaking of
comes to see you to-night, as he most likely will,
you must, for my sake and your own, speak very
pretty, and try to laugh and look happy and answer
all he says. It's only for once. For to-morrow&mdash;I
can't say for sure to-morrow&mdash;but I think it will
be, and I can't say the time&mdash;I'm going to do my
best to get you sent back to where you should
never have been taken from." She stopped a
moment as if to judge of the effect of her words.
For an instant the children did not speak; they
just stared at her with their blue eyes opened to
their widest extent, their little white faces looking
whiter than before, till gradually a rush of rosy
colour spread over them, the blue eyes filled with
tears, and both Duke and Pamela flung themselves
into the gipsy girl's arms.</p>

<p>"<i>Home</i>, do you mean, Diana?" they said. "Home
to our own dear Grandpapa and Grandmamma?"</p>

<p>"And Toby," added Duke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Toby," echoed Pam.</p>

<p>Diana clasped them tight; her eyes, that for
many a day had not shed a tear, were running
over.</p>

<p>"Yes, home, my blessed darlings," she said.</p>

<p>"But you'll come with us" was the next idea.
"You've been so good to us. Grandpapa'd never
put <i>you</i> in prison, Diana."</p>

<p>They sat up now and looked at her anxiously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," she said, shaking her head nevertheless.
"But I dursn't go with you. I must stay
here to stop them going the right way after you
for one thing. And then&mdash;you didn't know it, but,
bad as he is, Mick's my brother. I dursn't get
him into trouble."</p>

<p>"Mick's your bruvver!" repeated Pam; "the
same as bruvver is to me. And he speaks so
naughty to you, Diana. I don't fink he <i>can</i> be
your bruvver. I fink you've made a mistake. Oh
do come wif us, dear Diana. You and Tim."</p>

<p>"Yes for Tim, it'd be the best thing he could
do, and the best chance for you to get safe home.
But for me," and again Diana shook her head.
"Let alone Mick, I'm only a poor wild gipsy girl,"
she said. "I couldn't take to your pretty quiet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>ways; no, it'd kill me. It's in the gipsy blood&mdash;we
must for ever be on the go. It wasn't so bad
long ago when father and mother was alive. Father
was honest&mdash;he was a gentleman gipsy, he was.
But Mick's another sort. If I could get away from
him I would&mdash;but not so as to get him into trouble.
I'll try some day to get among a better lot. There's
bad and good among us, though you mightn't believe
it. But here am I wasting time talking of myself,
and I want to tell you all I'm thinking of. First,
do you know the name of the village or town
nearest where you live?"</p>

<p>"Sandle'ham," said the children.</p>

<p>"But is that near your home?" pursued Diana.
The twins shook their heads. They didn't know.</p>

<p>"Us was there once," said Duke. "But it was a
long time ago. It seemed a very far way."</p>

<p>"And is there no village nearer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said Pamela. "There's where
Barbara Twiss and the butcher Live, and where the
church is."</p>

<p>"And what's it called?"</p>

<p>"What's it called?" repeated the children.
"Why, it's just called the village. It isn't called
anything else."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what I was afraid of," said Diana.
"And it was all new country thereabouts to me.
Well, there's nothing for it but to make for Sandle'ham,
and once there Tim must go to the police."</p>

<p>At this dreadful word the children set up a
shriek, but Diana quickly stopped them.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" she said, "you'll have them all
coming to see what's the matter. The police won't
hurt <i>you</i>, you silly children. They'd be your best
friends if only they could find you. I'd rather have
had nothing to say to them, for fear they should get
too much out of Tim, but I see no other way to get
you safe home. But now we mustn't talk any more,
only remember all I've said if that man comes.
And to-morrow, when I give you the word, you
must be ready," she went on impressively; "you
won't be afraid with Tim. I'll do the best I can,
but we'll have to trust a deal to Tim; and you
must do just what he tells you, and never mind if
it seems strange and hard. It's the only chance for
them," she added to herself, with a strange longing
in her beautiful dark eyes, as she again left them,
"but if I could but have taken them safe back
myself I'd have felt easier in my mind."</p>

<p>She put in her head again to warn the children
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>not to try to speak to Tim, and if they must speak
to each other to do so in a whisper.</p>

<p>But at first their hearts seemed too full to speak.
They just sat with their arms round each other, too
bewildered and almost stunned with the good news
to take it in.</p>

<p>"Bruvver," said Pamela at last, "don't you fink
it's because us has said our prayers such many many
times?"</p>

<p>"P'raps," replied Duke.</p>

<p>"And you <i>don't</i> fink now what&mdash;you know what
you said about Grandpapa and Grandmamma," said
Pamela, her voice faltering.</p>

<p>Duke hesitated. He was not quite generous
enough to own that his gloomy prophecies had been
a good deal the result of his being tired and cross
and contradictory. In his heart he had no misgiving
such as he had expressed to Pamela&mdash;he had no
idea that what he had said might really have been
true.</p>

<p>"You <i>don't</i> fink so, bruvver?" persisted Pam.</p>

<p>"I daresay if us goes back very soon it'll make
them better even if they are very ill. I think us
had better put that in our prayers too&mdash;for us to
get back to them so quick that there won't be time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>for them to get very ill. I wouldn't mind them
being just a <i>little</i> ill, would you, sister? It'd be so
nice to see them getting better."</p>

<p>"I'd <i>rather</i> they wasn't ill at all," said Pamela,
"but I daresay God'll understand. Oh I <i>wish</i> it
was to-morrow! don't you, bruvver?"</p>

<p>"Hush," said Duke. "Diana said us mustn't talk
loud&mdash;and see, sister, they're going to put the horse
in and go on again. Oh how tired I am of going
along shaking like this all day! And don't you
remember, sister, when us was little us used to
think it would be <i>so</i> nice to live in a cart like a
house, like this?"</p>

<p>"Us never thought how <i>nugly</i> it would be
inside," said Pamela, glancing round the little
square space in which they were with great dissatisfaction.
And no wonder&mdash;the waggon was
stuffed with bundles and packages of all shapes and
sizes; on the sides hung dirty coats and cloaks
belonging to some of the tribe, and the only pleasant
object to be seen was a heap of nice clean-looking
baskets and brooms, which had been brought
in here, as the basket-cart was already filled to
overflowing. For the gipsies expected to do a good
trade in these things at the Crookford fair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish Diana would give us one of these nice
baskets to take home&mdash;a present to Grandmamma,"
continued Pamela, as her glance fell upon them.</p>

<p>"You're very silly, sister," said Duke. "Don't
you understand that us is going to <i>run away</i>, like
Tim has always been wanting. And Diana's going
to help us to run away. Mick mustn't know and
nobody, not till us is too far for them to catch us.
I think it's a great pity Diana told you; you're too
little to understand."</p>

<p>"I'm as big as you, bruvver, and my birfday's
the same. You're very unkind to say I'm littler
than you, and I <i>do</i> understand."</p>

<p>She spoke indignantly, but the last words ended
in tears. Poor little people!&mdash;life in a gipsy caravan
was not the sort of thing to improve their tempers.
But the dispute was soon followed by a reconciliation,
and then they decided it was better not to talk
any more about what Diana had told them, but to
"make plans" inside their heads about how nice it
would be to go home again; how they would knock
at the door so softly, and creep into the parlour
where Grandmamma would be sitting by the fire
with Toby at her feet, and Grandpapa at the table
with the newspaper; and <i>how</i> they would hug them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>both! At which point you will see the plan
making was no longer confined to the "inside of
their heads."</p>

<p>"And Duke," added Pamela half timidly. "Us
must tell all about the broken bowl. And us must
always tell everything like that to Grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Duke.</p>

<p>"I fink my voice that Grandmamma told us
about <i>did</i> tell me to tell," pursued the little girl
thoughtfully. "Didn't yours, bruvver?"</p>

<p>"I sometimes think it did," said Duke with
unusual humility. "I think it must have been that
I wouldn't listen. You would have listened, sister.
It was much more my fault than yours. I shall
tell <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"No, no, it was bof our faults," said Pamela.
"But I fink Grandpapa and Grandmamma will be
so very pleased to have us that they won't care
whose fault it was."</p>

<p>And then the two little creatures leant their
heads each on the other's, and tried to keep themselves
steady against the rough jolting, till by
degrees&mdash;and it was the best thing they could have
done&mdash;they both fell asleep, and were sleeping as
peacefully as in their own white cots at home when,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>later in the afternoon, Diana got into the waggon
again, and, rolling up an old shawl, carefully laid it
as a pillow under the two fair heads. It was getting
dusk by now, and the gipsies all disappeared into the
vans, for they began to drive too quickly for it to be
possible for them to keep up by walking alongside.</p>

<p>The gipsy girl sat there gazing at the two little
faces she had learnt to love. She gazed at them
with a deep tenderness in her dark eyes. She knew
it was almost the last time she should see them,
but it was not of that she was thinking.</p>

<p>"If I could but have taken them back myself
and seen them safe!" she kept thinking. "But I
daren't. With Tim no one will notice them much,
but with me it'd be different. And it'd get Mick
and the others into trouble, even if I didn't care
for myself. It's safer for them too for me to stay
behind. But how to get them safe out of Crookford!
I must speak to Tim. And I don't care
what Mick says or does after this. I'll never, <i>never</i>
again have a hand in this kind of business; he may
steal horses and poultry and what he likes, but I'll
have no more to do with stealing children. If ill
had come, or did come, to these innocent creatures
I'd never know another easy moment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>The jolting had ceased, and it was quite dark before
Duke and Pamela awoke. But through the little
window of the van came twinkling lights, and as
they sat up and looked about them they heard a
good many unusual sounds&mdash;the voices of people
outside calling to each other, the noise of wheels
along stony roadways&mdash;a sort of general clatter and
movement which soon told that the encampment for
the night was not, as hitherto, on the edge of some
quiet village or on a lonely moor.</p>

<p>"Bruvver," said Pamela, who had been the first
to rouse up, "are you awake? What a long time
us has been asleep! Is it the middle of the night,
and what a noise there is."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Duke slowly collected his ideas. He did not
speak, but he stood up on the bench and peeped
out of the window.</p>

<p>"It must be that big place where there's a fair,"
he said. "Look, sister, there's lots and lots of carts
and peoples. And over there do you see there's
rows of little shops&mdash;that must be the fair."</p>

<p>He seemed rather excited, but Pamela, after one
peep, would not look any more.</p>

<p>"No, no, bruvver," she said. "I am frightened.
If it is the fair, that man will be coming that Diana
told us about, and perhaps he'll take us before
Diana and Tim can help us to run away. I'm too
frightened."</p>

<p>But Duke had managed to get the window
unhooked, and was now on tiptoe, stretching out
his head as far as it would go.</p>

<p>"Oh sister," he exclaimed, drawing it in again,
"you <i>should</i> see. It's such a big place, and such
lots and lots of peoples, and such a noise. Oh do
climb up here, sister, and look out."</p>

<p>But Pamela still cowered down in her corner.
Suddenly they heard the well-known sound of the
key in the door,&mdash;for when the children were alone
in the van they were always locked in,&mdash;and turning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>to look, they saw Diana. She brought with her a
bowl of milk and some bread, which the children were
very glad of, as they had eaten so little at dinner,
and she said nothing till they had finished it.</p>

<p>"Are you still sleepy?" she said then. "Would
you like to go to bed or to come out a little with
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, to go out a little," said Duke; but Pamela
crept up close to Diana.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go out," she said. "I'm
frightened. But I don't want to stay here alone
for fear that man should come. Can't you help us
to run away now, before he comes? Oh please do,
dear Diana."</p>

<p>Diana soothed her very kindly.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, missy dear," she said.
"He won't be coming just yet. I think you'd
better come out a little with me. You'll sleep
better for it."</p>

<p>"And you won't take us to that man?" said
Pamela half suspiciously.</p>

<p>Diana looked at her reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Missy, missy dear, would I do such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Sister, you know she wouldn't," said Duke.</p>

<p>"Then I'll come," said Pamela, and in another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>minute the two children, each with a hand of the
gipsy girl, were threading their way through the
lanes of vans and carts, half-completed booths,
tethered horses and donkeys, men, women, and
children of all kinds, which were assembled on the
outskirts of Crookford in preparation for the great
fair. Nobody noticed them much, though one or
two gipsies loitering about, not of her own party,
nodded at Diana as she passed as an old acquaintance,
with some more or less rough joke or word of
greeting. And those belonging to Mick's caravan
did not seem surprised at seeing the children at
freedom. This was what Diana wished, and it had
been partly with this object, as well as to accustom
Duke and Pamela a little to their present quarters,
that she had managed to get leave to take them out
a little, late as it was. It had seemed quite dark
outside&mdash;looking through the window of the van&mdash;but
in reality it was only dusk, though the lights
moving about, the fires lit here and there in little
stoves outside the booths, and the general bustle
and confusion, made it a very bewildering scene.
Pamela tried not to be frightened, but she clutched
Diana's hand close, till suddenly, on turning a
corner, they ran against a boy coming at full speed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
It was Tim, and the little girl let go of Diana to
spring to him with a cry of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Oh Tim, dear Tim," she cried, "us hasn't seen
you for such a long time!"</p>

<p>"True enough, missy," he said cheerfully; and,
looking at him more closely, both children noticed
that he did look brighter and merrier than ever,
little as he was in the habit of seeming sad. "It's
all right," he went on, turning to Diana; "such a
piece o' luck!"</p>

<p>"Come and tell me as soon as we come back,"
said the girl. "I'll be in the van putting them to
bed. Mick's off&mdash;gone to look for the Signor. I'll
try for them to be asleep when <i>they</i> come," and with
these rather mysterious words Diana drew on the
children, and Tim ran off with a nod.</p>

<p>They walked on till they got a little clear of the
crowd, and on to a road evidently leading out of the
town. It had grown darker, but the moon had
risen, and by her light at some little distance the
children saw the same silvery thread that they had
noticed winding along below them from the high
moorland some days before.</p>

<p>"That's the river where the boats are like houses&mdash;that
Tim told us about," said Pamela.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Diana, "it's the canal. It comes
right into the town over that way," and she pointed
the left. "The boats take stone from hereabouts,&mdash;there's
lots of quarries near Crookford. I wanted
you to see it, for we've been thinking, Tim and me&mdash;it's
more his thought than mine&mdash;that that'd be
the best way for you to get away. Mick'll not be
likely to think of the canal, and Tim's been down
to see if there was any one among the boat-people
as would take you. He used to know some of them
not far from here. And the canal goes straight on
to a place called Monkhaven, on the road to
Sandle'ham. Did you ever hear of that place?"</p>

<p>The children shook their heads.</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped. That's as far as you
can get by the canal. After that Tim must use his
wits and look about him; and when you get to
Sandle'ham I'm afraid there's no help for it&mdash;you'll
have to ask the police to take you home."</p>

<p>"But Tim too?" said Pamela. "Tim's to go
home with us."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Diana. "I hope the old
gentleman and lady will be good to him, poor boy!
Tell them it was none of <i>his</i> fault, your being stolen
away&mdash;he's but a poor homeless waif himself; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>even if so be as they could do nothing for him, he
mustn't come back here. Mick'd be like to kill
him."</p>

<p>"But Grandpapa and Grandmamma will be good
to him. I <i>know</i> they will," said Duke and Pamela
together. "They'd be good to you too, Diana," they
added timidly.</p>

<p>But Diana again shook her head.</p>

<p>"That can't be," she said. "Still, when all this
has blown over a bit, I'll try to hear of you some
day. Tim'll maybe be able to let me know the
name of the place where your home is."</p>

<p>"And you must come to see us. Oh yes, yes&mdash;you
must, Diana!" said the children, dancing about
with glee. The girl looked at them in some surprise;
it was the first time she had seen them merry
and light-hearted as they were at home, and it made
her better understand how wretched their new life
must have been for them to change them so.</p>

<p>"I'll try," she said; "but it doesn't much matter
for that. The thing is for you to be safe at home
yourselves."</p>

<p>Then she said it was time to go back. It was
quite dark by now, and the children kept very close
to her as they found themselves again in the rabble
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>of the behind-the-scenes of the fair. People there
too were beginning to shut up for the night, for
most of them, poor things, had been working hard
all day.</p>

<p>As they came up to where Mick's party had
encamped, Diana said something in the queer
language the children did not understand to some of
the gipsies who were hanging about. Their answer
seemed to relieve her.</p>

<p>"Come, children," she said; "you must be tired.
I'll get you to bed as quick as I can; and try to
get to sleep. It's the best thing you can do."&mdash;"They'll
not be coming just yet, maybe," she added
to herself, "if they've got to drinking over their
bargain; so much the better perhaps. If only the
children are asleep they'll perhaps be none the wiser,
and I'll hear all there is to hear."</p>

<p>The preparing for bed was a different thing
indeed from the careful washing, hair-brushing, and
attiring in snow-white nightgowns that was called
"undressing" "at home." All that Diana could
manage in the way of washing apparatus was a
rough wooden tub with cold water, a bit of coarse
soap, and an old rag by way of a towel! And even
this she had done more to please the children than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>because she saw any need for it. This evening she
made no pretence of anything after taking off the
children's outer clothes&mdash;Duke's nankin suit, now
sadly soiled and dilapidated, and the old red flannel
skirt and little shawl which had replaced Pamela's
white frock. The frock was still in existence; but
by Mick's orders Diana had trimmed it up gaudily
for the child to make her appearance in to the
Signor; so the little girl's attire was certainly very
gipsy-like.</p>

<p>"Shall I have to go home to Grandmamma with
this nugly old petticoat and no frock?" she asked,
when Diana had taken off all her clothes down to
her little flannel vest, and wrapped her up for the
night in a clean, though old, cotton bedgown of her
own. "And why have you taken off my chemise,
Diana? I've kept it on other nights."</p>

<p>"I'm going to wash it," said Diana. "I'd like
to send you back as decent as I <i>can</i>."</p>

<p>Pamela seemed satisfied. Then she and Duke
knelt together at the side of the shake-down Diana
called their bed, and said their prayers together and
aloud. The gipsy girl had heard them before&mdash;several
times&mdash;but this evening she listened with
peculiar attention, and when at the end the little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>creatures, after praying for dear Grandpapa and
Grandmamma, and that God would please soon take
them safe home again, went on to add a special
petition for "dear Diana," who had been so kind to
them, that she might be always good and happy,
and that Mick and nobody should be unkind to her,
the girl turned away her face to hide the tears which
slowly welled up into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Good-night, dear Diana," said the two little
voices, as she stooped to kiss them.</p>

<p>"Good-night, master and missy. Sleep well,
and don't be frightened if you're wakened up. I'll
be here." Then, as she was turning away, she
hesitated. "Do you really think now," she said,
"that it's any good praying for a wild gipsy girl
like me?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Pamela, starting up
again. "Why shouldn't it be as much good for
you as for any one? If you want to be good&mdash;and
I think you are good, Diana&mdash;you can't help praying
to God. For all the good comes from Him.
That's what Grandmamma told us. And He puts
little bits of His good into us."</p>

<p>Diana looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes," persisted Pamela, nodding her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
"There's like a little voice that speaks inside us&mdash;that
tells us when we're" (Pamela could use the
word "we," as correctly as possible when speaking
in general, not merely of Duke and herself) "naughty
and when we're good."</p>

<p>In her turn Diana nodded her head.</p>

<p>"And the more we listen to it the plainer we
hear it," added Pamela.</p>

<p>"<i>Us</i> didn't listen to it when us found that Toby
had brokened the bowl," said Duke gravely. "At
least I didn't, and it leaves off speaking when people
doesn't listen."</p>

<p>Diana had long ago heard the story of the
beginning of the children's troubles.</p>

<p>"Listening to it is almost like praying, you see,
Diana," said Pamela. "And of course when we
know all the good comes from God, it's only <i>sense</i>
to pray to Him, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," said the gipsy quietly.
"Now go to sleep as fast as you can."</p>

<p>Easier in their innocent minds about their own
affairs by a great deal than Diana was <i>for</i> them,
the twins quickly followed her advice. But Diana
dared not go to rest herself; in the first place she
had a long talk with Tim in a corner where they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>could not be overheard, and then, finding that Mick
had not yet come back, she hung about, terrified of
his returning with the Signor, and frightening the
poor children, without her being at hand.</p>

<p>"You'd best go to bed, I think," said Tim. "I
'spex he's got to drinking somewhere, and he won't
be seen to-night."</p>

<p>"I dursn't," said Diana. "He might come any
minute, and that man might want to carry them off
in their sleep, so as to have no noise about it."</p>

<p>"But how could you stop him?" asked Tim,
his merry face growing very sober.</p>

<p>"I'd do my best, and you must be ready, you
know," she said.</p>

<p>"He'd be in a nice taking if he didn't find the
Signor, or if <i>he</i> wanted to back out of it," said Tim.</p>

<p>"Not much fear of that," said Diana. "The
Signor's too sharp; he'll soon see he couldn't get
such a pretty pair once in twenty years. He's a
man I shudder at; once he wanted me to join his
show, but, bad and cruel as Mick is, I'd rather have
to do with him. But hush, Tim, there they are! I
hear Mick's voice swearing&mdash;they're coming this
way. Run you off and hide yourself, but try to
creep up to the van where the children are when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>they're gone, and I'll tell you what has to be
done."</p>

<p>Tim disappeared with marvellous quickness.
Diana rose to her feet and went forward a little,
with a light in her hand, to meet her brother. He
was accompanied, as she expected, by the Signor, and
she saw in a moment that Mick was more than
half drunk, and in a humour which might become
dangerous at any moment.</p>

<p>"He's made him drunk," she said to herself,
"thinking he'll drive a better bargain. He'd
better have let him alone."</p>

<p>The Signor was a very small, dark, fat man&mdash;dressed,
as he considered, "quite like a gentleman."
He had bright, beady, twinkling eyes, and a way of
smiling and grinning as if he did not think nature
had made him enough like a monkey already, in
which I do not think any one would have agreed
with him!</p>

<p>"So here's your handsome sister, my friend
Mick," he said, as he caught sight of Diana&mdash;"handsomer
than ever. And you were coming to
meet us, were you&mdash;very amiable I'm sure."</p>

<p>Mick, whose eyes were dazzled by the light, and
who was too stupid to take in things quickly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>frowned savagely when he saw the girl standing
quietly before him.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting there for?" he said,
with some ugly words. "There's no need of <i>you</i>.
Get out of the way. I know where to find the
childer. The Signor and I can manage our own
affairs."</p>

<p>"Can you?" said Diana contemptuously. "Well,
good-night, then. You'll waken them up and frighten
them so that they'll scream for the whole fair to
hear them. And how the Signor means to get
them away quietly if they do so <i>I</i> can't say.
There'd maybe be some awkward questions to
answer as to how they came among us at all, if
some of the people about should be honest, decent
folk. And there are fools of that kind where you'd
little look for them sometimes. However, it's no
business of mine, as you say. Good-night," and she
turned away.</p>

<p>The Signor turned to Mick with a very evil look
in his face.</p>

<p>"Fool that <i>you</i> are," he muttered, but Mick only
stared at him stupidly. The Signor caught his arm
and shook him. "Are you going to let her go
off?" he said. "You told me yourself she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>looked after the brats and could do anything with
them, and now you go and set her back up! She's
fit to rouse the place out of spite, she is. And I
can tell you I'm not going to get myself into
trouble about these children you've made such a
fuss about. I've not seen them yet, and rather
than risk anything I'll be off," and he, in turn,
seemed as if he were going off.</p>

<p>This roused Mick.</p>

<p>"Stay, stay&mdash;wait a bit," he said eagerly,
"Diana," he called,&mdash;and as Diana was in reality
only waiting behind a shed she soon appeared again,&mdash;"I
were only joking. Of course it's for you to
show the Signor the pretty dears&mdash;such care as
she's had of them, so bright and merry as she's
taught them to be, you wouldn't believe," he went
on in a half whine. "It'll be a sore trouble to her
to part with them&mdash;you'll have to think o' that,
Signor. I've promised Diana we'd act handsome
by <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," said the other, with a
sneer. "Sure to be handsome doings where you
and me's concerned, friend Mick. But where <i>are</i>
the creatures? You're not playing me a trick after
all, are you?" he went on, looking round as if he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>expected to see the children start up from the earth
or drop down from the sky.</p>

<p>"This way," said Diana, more civilly than she
had yet spoken, "follow me if you please&mdash;they're
close by."</p>

<p>In another minute she was standing on the steps
of the van with the key in the lock. Then suddenly
she turned and faced the Signor.</p>

<p>"They're asleep," she said. "I kept them up
and awake a long time, but I hadn't thought you'd
be so late. I can wake them up if you like, and if
they saw me there they wouldn't cry. But they'd
be half asleep&mdash;there'd be no getting them to show
off to-night. But of course it's as the Signor
chooses."</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously. He was surprised
to find her seemingly as eager as Mick that he
should think well of the merchandise they were
offering him for sale! He had rather expected the
gipsy girl to set herself against the transaction, for
he knew she disliked him, and that no money would
have persuaded her herself to join his "troupe."
But he was too low himself to explain anything in
others except by the lowest motives. "She thinks
she'll get something handsome out of me if she's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>civil about it," he said to himself. Seeing, however,
that civility was to be the order of the day, he
answered her with an extra quantity of grins.</p>

<p>"Quite of your opinion, my young lady. Better
not disturb the little dears. Should like a look at
them, however, with your kind assistance."</p>

<p>Diana said no more, but, unlocking and opening
the door, stepped carefully into the van, followed by
her companions&mdash;Mick remaining somewhat behind,
probably because he could not have got quite into
the recesses of the waggon without tumbling, and
such sense as remained to him telling him he had
better not make a noise. The van inside was
divided in two&mdash;something after the manner of a
bathing-machine, such as I daresay most children
have often seen. The door in the middle was not
locked, and Diana pushed it softly open; then,
advancing with the light held high so as to show
the children's faces without flaring painfully upon
them, stood at one side and signed to the Signor to
come forward. And he was too much startled and
impressed&mdash;ugly, cold-hearted little wretch though
he was&mdash;by the sight before him to notice the
strange, half-triumphant, half-defiant expression on
Diana's dark beautiful face.</p>

<div class='center'><small>"UPON MY WORD THEY ARE SOMETHING QUITE OUT OF THE COMMON," HE SAID;<br />
"I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED THEM FOR A GOOD DEAL. WHAT A KING AND<br />
QUEEN OF THE PIGMIES, OR 'BABES IN THE WOOD,' THEY'D MAKE."</small>&mdash;p. <a href='#Page_173'>173</a>.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"There they are," it seemed to say, "and could
anything be lovelier? <i>Wouldn't</i> you like to have
them?"</p>

<p>They lay there&mdash;the delicate little faces flushed
with "rosy sleep"&mdash;the fair fluffy hair like a golden
shadow on the rough cushion which served as a
pillow, each with an arm thrown round the other;
they looked so like each other that even Diana
was not sure which was which. No pair of fairies
decoyed from their own country could have been
prettier.</p>

<p>The Signor was startled into speaking the truth
for once.</p>

<p>"Upon my word they are something quite out
of the common," he said; "I wouldn't have missed
them for a good deal. What a king and queen of the
pigmies, or 'babes in the wood,' they'd make! I'll
have to get something set up on purpose for them.
And they're sharp at learning and speak plain you
say?&mdash;at least he did," he added, turning round to
look for Mick, who by this time had lurched up to
the middle door of the van and was leaning on the
lintel, looking in stupidly.</p>

<p>"Ay, they're sharp enough, and pretty spoken
too," said Diana.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sharp and pretty spoken," echoed Mick.</p>

<p>"Then I'm your man," said the Signor; "I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the girl interrupted him.</p>

<p>"There's one thing to be said," she began. "You
must not think of letting them be seen hereabouts.
You might get yourself and us too into trouble. It's
too near where they come from."</p>

<p>The Signor held up his hands warningly.</p>

<p>"Hush," he said, "I don't want to know nothing
of all that. They're two desolate orphans, picked
up by you out of charity, and I take them to teach
them a way of gaining a livelihood. That's all
about it."</p>

<p>"Well, all the same, you can do nothing with
them hereabouts," repeated Diana, anxious to gain
time to put into execution the plans of escape.
"You'd better leave them here quietly with us till
after the fair. No one shall see them except those
who've seen them already."</p>

<p>They were in the outer half of the van by now,
for Diana, afraid of disturbing the children, had
drawn back with the light, and the Signor had
followed her.</p>

<p>At her last speech he turned upon her with
sudden and angry suspicion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no," he said. "I'll have no tricks served
me. Have you been putting your handsome sister
up to this, Mick, you fool? You promised me the
brats at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, at once. You shall have them at once
when you pay me," said Mick, beginning to get
angry in turn, "but not before. I don't want to
keep them&mdash;not I; they're the pest of my life, they
are, but I'll see my money or you shall never set
eyes on them again."</p>

<p>And he looked so stolidly obstinate that the
other man glanced at Diana as if for advice.</p>

<p>"You'd better have left him alone," she said in
a low voice, contemptuously. "If you make him
angry now he's not sober, there's no saying what
he'll do."</p>

<p>The Signor began to be really afraid that his prey
might slip through his hands. He turned to Diana.</p>

<p>"I'm one for quick work and no shilly-shallying,"
he said. "And I have Mick's word for it. He's
signed a paper. I'll take care to get myself and
you into no trouble, but I must have the children
at once. Now listen, Mick. I'll be here to-morrow
morning at say eight&mdash;well, nine o'clock, with the
money. And you must have the children ready&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>and
help me to take 'em off quietly, or&mdash;or&mdash;I
don't want no bother," he added meaningly.</p>

<p>"All right," said Mick; "they'll be ready," and
he followed the Signor down the steps of the van,
Diana still holding the light.</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock," said the Signor once more, as if
he depended more on the girl than on the man.</p>

<p>"At nine o'clock," she repeated, and she stood
there till quite sure that the Signor had taken himself
off, and that Mick had no intention of returning.</p>

<p>Then she blew out the light and crept softly in
and out among the vans, tethered horses, etc., forming
the gipsy caravan, till she came to the waggon
where she knew Tim slept. He was wide awake,
expecting her, and in answer to her whispered call
said nothing till they had got some yards away.</p>

<p>"I think the other boys is asleep," he said,
"but best make sure. Well, Diana?"</p>

<p>"You must go at once&mdash;no, not just at once, but
as soon as the dawn breaks. That man's coming
for them at nine, and once in his hands&mdash;&mdash;!"
Diana shook her head, and though she said no more
the boy understood her, that then all hope of escape
would be gone.</p>

<p>"I'll be ready," said Tim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The children were still sleeping when the first
straggling feeble rays of dawn began to creep
through the darkness. Diana stood at the door of
the van and looked anxiously at the sunrise. Her
experienced eye soon saw that it was going to be a
fine day, and she gave a sigh of relief. She was
still dressed as she had been the night before, for
she had not slept, not lain down even&mdash;so great
had been her fear of falling asleep&mdash;at all. She
had spent all the dark hours in preparing for the
flight of the little prisoners&mdash;all that her hands,
untrained in such matters as sewing and mending,
could do to make the twins appear in decent guise
on their return to their own home had been done.
And now all was ready. There was nothing to do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>but to wake them and explain to them what was
before them. Tim was already up and off&mdash;for she
had arranged with him to meet the children a little
way out of the town, and he had tapped at the
door of the van as he passed.</p>

<p>There was no one stirring among the queer
inhabitants of the fair, as Diana remarked with
satisfaction. Everything was perfectly still, and
with a sigh the gipsy girl stepped up into the van
again and went through to the inner part. Duke
and Pamela were lying much as they had been the
evening before. It seemed a pity to wake them,
but it had to be done. Diana stooped down and
gently shook Duke's arm.</p>

<p>"Master," she said,&mdash;"master and missy, you
must wake up."</p>

<p>Duke opened his sleepy eyes and stared before
him; Pamela, more quickly awakened, started up,
crying:</p>

<p>"What is it, Diana? It isn't that naughty man
come for us?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said the gipsy, glad to see that Pamela
had her wits about her. "It is that Tim is ready
to run away with you, as you've so often planned.
And you must get up and dress as quick as you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>can before Mick or any one is awake, for the man
will be coming this morning, and I must have you
ever so far away before then."</p>

<p>Her words completely aroused both children.
In an instant they were on their feet, nervously
eager to be dressed and off. There was no question
of baths <i>this</i> morning, but Diana washed their faces
and hands well, and smoothed their tangled hair.</p>

<p>"I must make them as tidy as I can," she said
to herself with a sob in her throat.</p>

<p>Duke saw with satisfaction that his nankin
suit&mdash;which Diana had persuaded him not to wear
the day before, having lent him a pair of trowsers
of Tim's, which she had washed on purpose, and in
which, doubled up nearly to his waist, he looked
very funny&mdash;was quite clean; and Pamela, to her
still greater surprise, found herself attired in a tidy
little skirt and jacket of dark blue stuff, with a little
hood of the same for her head.</p>

<p>"Why, what's this?" she said. "It's a new
gown!"</p>

<p>"I made it," said Diana quietly. "I wanted
you to look as tidy as I could. You'll tell them,
missy dear&mdash;won't you?&mdash;that poor Diana did her
best."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed us will," cried both together. But
they did not know that the gipsy girl had cut up
her one decent dress to clothe little Pamela.</p>

<p>"And shall us see Grandpapa and Grandmamma
to-day?" they went on, hugging Diana in their joy
as they spoke.</p>

<p>"Not to-day, nor to-morrow, but before long, I
hope," she replied. And then, as they were eager
to go, "Won't you say your prayers, master and
missy, that you may come safe to your home; and,"
she added in a low voice, "ask God to show poor
Diana how to be good?"</p>

<p>"Us will always pray for you, dear Diana," they
said, after they had risen from their knees again,
"and some day, you know, you <i>must</i> come and see
us."</p>

<p>She did not answer, but, quickly lifting them
down the steps of the waggon, locked the door and
put the key in her pocket. Then, still without
speaking,&mdash;the children seeming to understand they
must be as quiet as possible,&mdash;she lifted Pamela in
her arms, and Duke running beside, they had soon
made their way out of the midst of the vans and
carts and booths, all of whose owners were still
asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>For even now it was barely dawn, and the air
felt chilly, as is generally the case early of a May
morning.</p>

<p>Diana walked so fast, though she had a big
basket as well as a little girl in her arms, that
Duke, though he would not have owned it, could
scarcely keep up with her. But at last, just as he
was beginning to feel he must cry mercy, she
slackened her pace and began to look about her.</p>

<p>"He should be somewhere near," she said, more
as if speaking to herself than to the children, and
just then, with a sort of whoop, out tumbled Tim
from the other side of a low hedge, where there
was a dry ditch in which he had been comfortably
lying.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Diana, glancing round her.</p>

<p>"There's no need," said Tim; "there's not a soul
within hearing. I needn't have come on before for
that matter. No one saw us start."</p>

<p>"And which way do you go now?" asked the
gipsy, setting Pamela down as she spoke, to the
child's great satisfaction, though she had not liked
to say to Diana that she was really too big to be
carried.</p>

<p>"Straight on for about half a mile," answered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>the boy; "then there's a road to the right takes us
straight to the canal. It's not light enough yet for
you to see, but there's a little house close to the
towing path over there, where the boats often stop
the night when it's crowded in the town. That's
where they're to be."</p>

<p>"All right," said Diana. "I'll go with you to
the turn, and then I must get back as fast as I
can."</p>

<p>"Let me carry the basket," said Tim. He had
a bundle under his arm, but it was very light, for
his possessions were few.</p>

<p>"What's in the basket?" asked Duke.</p>

<p>"All I could get," said Diana. "Some bread
and eggs, and some oranges I bought last night. I
thought you'd be glad of them maybe. And Tim,
you have the money safe?"</p>

<p>Tim nodded his head.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they reached the road he had
spoken of. In silence poor Diana kissed the three
children and turned away, for she could not speak.
But Duke and Pamela burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Oh if you would but come with us," they said
over and over again. But Diana shook her head.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't cry, master and missy dear, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>go to your own home. It was a wicked shame to
take you from it, but I hope God will forgive me
the little I had to do with it, for I've truly done
my best to get you safe back. And you'll ask the
kind gentleman and lady to be good to poor Tim,
and put him in an honest way of life."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," sobbed the children. And then
Diana kissed them again and resolutely turned
away. But Tim ran after her.</p>

<p>"You don't think Mick'll beat you?" he said
anxiously.</p>

<p>"He shan't have the chance," she answered
scornfully. "No, no, Tim, I'll take care of myself.
Be a good boy; getting away from us is the best
thing could come to you. And some day maybe
I'll have news of you, and you of me perhaps."</p>

<p>Tim hastened back to the children, but his
merry face was sad and his heart heavy.</p>

<p>A short time brought them to the edge of the
canal, and there sure enough a boat was moored.
There was no one moving about the little house
Tim had pointed out, but on board the canal boat
two figures were to be seen&mdash;or rather three, for
they were those of a young man and a younger
woman with a baby in her arms; and in answer to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>a whistle from Tim the man came forward and called
out cheerfully, "Good morning; is it all right?"</p>

<p>"All right," called back Tim, and then he turned
to the children.</p>

<p>"We're going in this boat, master and missy.
See, won't it be fine fun, sailing away along the
canal?"</p>

<p>Pamela seemed a little frightened.</p>

<p>"You're sure he won't take us to that naughty
man?" she said, holding Tim's hand tight.</p>

<p>"Bless you, no; it's to get away from him we're
going in the boat. Peter&mdash;that's the name of the
man there&mdash;Peter's promised to take us as far as
he goes towards Sandle'ham. It's such a piece of
luck as never was to have come across him; he's
the cousin of the boy I told you of who let me stay
in his boat when I was a little 'un."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the children,&mdash;"oh yes, us remembers
that story. It was a boy and his mother. And
was it a boat just like this, Tim?"</p>

<p>"Not near so clean and tidy. This one's been
all new painted, don't you see? It's as clean as
clean. But we must be quick. Peter and I'll
jump you in. He's all ready to start. There's the
horse a-waiting."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Duke was quite content, but Pamela still hung
back a little.</p>

<p>"Us has never been in a boat," she said.</p>

<p>"Come on," called out Peter, and the young
woman with the baby came forward with a smile.</p>

<p>"You must look sharp," said Peter, in what was
meant to be an encouraging tone. "The morning's
getting on, you know," he added to Tim, "and if
those folk down yonder took it in their heads to
come this way it'd be awk'ard."</p>

<p>"I know," said Tim, and lifting Duke in his
arms he handed him over to Peter, thinking Pamela
would be sure to follow. So she was, for she
would have gone after "bruvver" down the crater
of Vesuvius itself I do believe, but she looked
white and trembled, and whispered piteously,</p>

<p>"I am so frightened, Tim."</p>

<p>"But it's better than if Mick had cotched us,
and you'd had to go to that Signor man, missy,"
said Tim encouragingly.</p>

<p>This appealed to Pamela's common sense, and in
a few minutes she seemed quite happy. For Peter's
wife introduced her to the baby, and as it was really
rather a nice baby&mdash;much cleaner than one could
have expected to find one of its species on a canal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>boat&mdash;the little girl soon found it a most interesting
object of study. She had seldom seen little babies,
and her pride was great when its mother proposed
to her to hold it on her own knee, and even allowed
her to pull off its socks to count for herself its ten
little round rosy buttons of toes. The toes proved
too much for Duke, who had hitherto stood rather
apart, considering himself, as a boy, beyond the
attractions of dolls and babies. But when Tim
even&mdash;great grown-up, twelve years old Tim&mdash;knelt
down to admire the tiny feet at Pamela's call,
Duke condescended to count the toes one by one
for himself, and to say what a pity it was Toby was
not here&mdash;baby could ride so nicely on Toby's back,
couldn't she? This idea, expressed with the greatest
gravity, set Peter and his wife off laughing, and all
five, or six if baby is to be included, were soon the
best friends in the world.</p>

<p>"How nice it is here," said Pamela; "I'm not
frightened now, Tim; only I wish Diana could
have come. It's so much nicer than in the waggon.
You don't think Mick will find out where us is, do
you, Tim?" and a little shudder passed through
her.</p>

<p>"Oh no, no; no fear," said Tim, but her words
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>reminded him and Peter that they were by no
means "out of the wood." Peter was far from
anxious for a fight with the gipsies, whose lawless
ways he knew well; and besides this, being a kind-hearted
though rough fellow, he had already begun
to feel an interest in the stolen children for their
own sake; though no doubt his consent to take
them as passengers had been won by the promises
of reward Tim had not hesitated to hold out.</p>

<p>He and the boy looked at each other.</p>

<p>"We must be starting," said the bargeman, and
he turned to jump ashore and attach the towing
ropes to the patient horse. "You must keep them
in the cabin for a while," he said to his wife.
"They mustn't risk being seen till we're a long way
out of Crookford."</p>

<p>Duke and Pamela looked up, but without clearly
understanding what their new host said. And Tim,
who saw that Peter's queer accent puzzled them,
was not sorry. He did not want them to be
frightened; he was frightened enough himself to do
for all three, he reflected, and they were so good and
biddable he could keep them quiet without rousing
their fears. For, though he could not have explained
his own feelings, it somehow went to the boy's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>heart to see the two little creatures already looking
happier and more peaceful than he had ever seen
them! Why should they not be quite happy?
They were going to Grandpapa and Grandmamma
and Toby; they had no longer cruel Mick to fear;
they had Tim to take care of them&mdash;only the
thought of poor Diana left behind made them a
little sad!</p>

<p>"It is so nice here," repeated Pamela, when
Tim's words had completely reassured her. "But
I'm rather hungry. Us hadn't any breakfast, you
know, Tim. Mightn't us, have some of the bread in
the basket."</p>

<p>"I've got some bread and some fresh milk,"
said Mrs. Peter. "I got the milk just before you
came; the girl at the 'Rest'"&mdash;the 'Rest' was the
little house where the canal boats stopped&mdash;"fetched
it early."</p>

<p>"Oh, us would like some milk," said the children
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Come into the cabin then, and you'll show me
what you have in your basket," said the young
woman; and thus the children were easily persuaded
to put themselves in hiding.</p>

<p>The cabin was but one room, though with what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>in a house would have been called a sort of "lean-to,"
large enough to hold a bed. All was, of course,
very tidy, but so much neater and, above all, cleaner
than the gipsies' van that Duke and Pamela thought
it delightful. The boat had been newly repaired
and painted, and besides this, Peter's wife&mdash;though
she could neither read nor write and had spent all
her life on a canal boat&mdash;was quite a wonder in her
love of tidiness and cleanliness.</p>

<p>"I'd like to live here always," said Pamela,
whose spirits rose still higher when she had had
some nice fresh milk and bread.</p>

<p>"Not without Grandpapa and Grandmamma,"
said Duke reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Oh no, of course not," said Pamela. "But
there wouldn't be quite enough room for them in
here, would there, Mrs. Peter?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not," she replied. "You see there's
only one bed. But we've made a nice place for
you, master and missy, in here," and she drew back
a clean cotton curtain in one corner, behind which,
on a sort of settle, Peter and she had placed one of
their mattresses so as to make a nice shake-down.
"You'll sleep very well in here, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," exclaimed the children, "us will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>very comfortable. What nice clean sheets!" continued
Pamela; "it makes me fink of our white
beds at home," and her voice grew rather doleful, as
if she were going to cry.</p>

<p>"But you've no need to cry about your home
<i>now</i>, missy dear," said Tim. "You're on the way
there."</p>

<p>"Yes, how silly I am!" said Pamela. "I fink
I forgot. It's such a long time ago since us slept
in a nice clean bed with sheets. I wish it was
time to go to bed now."</p>

<p>"I think it would be a very good plan if you
and master was to take a little sleep. You must
be tired getting up so early," suggested Mrs. Peter,
devoutly hoping they would agree to let themselves
be quietly stowed away behind the checked cotton
curtain. For poor Mrs. Peter was dreadfully afraid
of the gipsies, and her motive in agreeing to befriend
Tim and the children was really far more the wish
to save them from the hands they had fallen among
than any hope of reward.</p>

<p>"I'd rather bury baby, bless her, any day, than
think of her among such," she had said on hearing
the story.</p>

<p>Duke and Pamela looked longingly at the "nice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>white sheets." They were both, to tell the truth,
very sleepy, but dignity had to be considered.</p>

<p>"It's only babies that go to bed in the day,
Nurse says," objected Duke. "She said so one day
that us got into our beds, and she said us had
dirtied them with our shoes. Us had been playing
in the garden."</p>

<p>"But you've no need to keep your shoes on," said
Mrs. Peter. "And many a big person's very glad
to take a sleep in the day, when they're tired and
have been up very early maybe."</p>

<p>So at last the twins allowed themselves to be
persuaded, and Mrs. Peter's heart, and Tim's too, for
that matter, were considerably lighter when the
curtain was drawn forward and no trace of the
little passengers was to be seen. Tim, following
the young woman's advice, curled himself up in a
corner where he was easily hidden.</p>

<p>"And now," said Mrs. Peter, "I'll just go up on
the deck as usual, so that if any boats pass us who
know us by sight, they'll never think we've any
runaways on board; though for my part I can't
see as that Mick'd dare to make much stir, seeing
as he might be had up for stealing them."</p>

<p>"It's not him I'm so much afeared of as that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Signor," said Tim. "He's such a terrible sharp
one, Diana says."</p>

<p>"But the perlice must be after the children by
now," persisted Mrs. Peter. "And every one far
and wide knows of Crookford Fair and the gipsies
that comes to it."</p>

<p>"P'raps they've never thought of gipsies," said
Tim; and in this, as we know, he was about right.</p>

<p>The day passed peacefully. They met several
boats making for Crookford, who hailed them as
usual, and they were overtaken by one or two
others making their way more quickly, because
towed by two horses. But whether or not there
had been any inquiry among the canal people at
Crookford after the children, Peter and his party
were left unmolested, and the sight of his wife and
baby as usual on the deck would have prevented
any one suspecting anything out of the common.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when the three&mdash;for Tim
had slept as soundly as the others&mdash;awoke. At
first, in their nest behind the curtain, Duke and
Pamela could not imagine where they were&mdash;then
the touch and sight of the clean sheets recalled
their memory.</p>

<p>"Oh, bruvver, aren't you glad?" said Pamela.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
"I wonder what o'clock it is, and if we've come a
long way. Oh, I'm so hungry! I wonder where
Tim is!"</p>

<p>Up jumped the boy like a faithful hound at
the sound of his own name.</p>

<p>"Here I am, missy," he said, rubbing his eyes.
"I've been asleep too&mdash;it makes one sleepy, I think,
the smooth way the boat slips along."</p>

<p>"Not like the jogging and jolting in the van,"
said Duke. "I'm hungry too, Tim," he added.</p>

<p>"Just stop where you are a bit while I go out
on the deck and see," said the boy.</p>

<p>He made his way cautiously, peeping out before
he let himself be seen. The coast was clear, however.
Mrs. Peter was knitting tranquilly, baby
asleep on her knee&mdash;Peter himself enjoying an
afternoon pipe.</p>

<p>For it was already afternoon.</p>

<p>"You've had a good nap, all on you," said the
young woman, smiling. "I thought you'd 'a wakened
up for your dinner. But I looked in two or
three times and the little dears was sleeping like
angels in a picture&mdash;so Peter and I we thought it
would be a pity to disturb you. Had you so far
to come this morning?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not far at all," said Tim. "I cannot think
what made me so sleepy, nor master and missy
neither. Perhaps it's the being so quiet-like here
after all the flurry of getting off and thinking they'd
be after us. It's not often I sleep past my dinner
time."</p>

<p>"I've kep' it for you," said Mrs. Peter. "There's
some baked 'taters hot in the pan, and maybe the
little master and missy'd like one of their eggs."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they would," said Tim; "a hegg and
a baked 'tater's a dinner for a king. And there's
the oranges for a finish up."</p>

<p>And he skipped back merrily to announce the
good news.</p>

<p>The dinner was thoroughly approved of by
Duke and Pamela, and after they had eaten it
they were pleased at being allowed to stay on the
deck of the boat, and to run about and amuse themselves
as they chose, for they had now left Crookford
so far behind them that Peter and his wife did not
think it likely any one would be coming in pursuit.</p>

<p>"They'd 'a been after us by now if they'd been
coming," said Peter. "A horse'd have overtook us
long afore this, and not going so very fast nayther."</p>

<p>The children had not enjoyed so much liberty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>for many weary days, and their merry laughter was
heard all over the boat, as they played hide-and-seek
with Tim, or paddled their hands in the clear
water, leaning over the sides of the boat. For they
were now quite out in the country, and the canal
bore no traces of the dirt of the town. It was a
very pretty bit of country too through which they
were passing; and though the little brother and
sister were too young to have admired or even
noticed a beautiful landscape of large extent, they
were delighted with the meadows dotted over with
daisies and buttercups, and the woods in whose
recesses primroses and violets were to be seen,
through which they glided.</p>

<div class='center'><small>"I DO FINK WHEN US IS QUITE BIG AND CAN DO AS US LIKES, US MUST HAVE A<br />
BOAT LIKE THIS, AND ALWAYS GO SAILING ALONG."</small>&mdash;p. <a href='#Page_195'>195</a>.</div>

<p>"I do fink when us is quite big and can do as
us likes, us must have a boat like this, and always
go sailing along," said Pamela, when, half-tired with
her play, she sat down beside the baby and its
mother.</p>

<p>"But it isn't always summer, or beautiful bright
weather like this, missy," said the young woman.
"It's not such a pleasant life in winter or even in
wet weather. Last week even it was sadly cold.
I hardly durst let baby put her nose out of the
cabin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then us'd only sail in the boat in fine
weather," said Pamela philosophically, to which of
course there was nothing to be said.</p>

<p>The next two days passed much in the same
way. The sunshine fortunately continued, and the
children saw no reason to change their opinion of
the charms of canal life, especially as now and then
Peter landed them on the banks for a good run in
the fields. And through all was the delightful feeling
that they were "going home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the last night on the canal. Early the next
morning they would be at Monkhaven. The
children were fast asleep; so were Peter and his
wife and baby. Only Tim was awake. He had
asked to stay on deck, as he was quite warm with
a rug which Mrs. Peter lent him, and the cabin
was full enough. It was a lovely night, and the
boy lay looking at the stars overhead thinking, with
rather a heavy heart. The nearer they got to the
children's home the more anxious he became, not
on their account but on his own. It would be so
dreadful to be turned adrift again, and, in spite of
all the little people's promises, he could not feel sure
that the old gentleman and lady would care to have
anything to say to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm such a rough one and I've been with such
a bad lot," thought the poor boy to himself while
the tears came to his eyes. But he looked up at the
stars again, and somehow their calm cheerful shining
seemed to give him courage. He had been on the
point of deciding that as soon as he was quite sure
of the children's safety he would run away, without
letting himself be seen at all, though where he
should run to or what would become of him he had
not the least idea! But the silvery light overhead
reminded him somehow of his beautiful dream, for
it illumined the boat and the water and the trees
as if they were painted by fairy fingers.</p>

<p>"It's come right so far, leastways as far as a
dream could be like to real things," he reflected.
"I don't see why it shouldn't come right all through.
Just to think how proud I'd be if they'd make me
stable-boy, or gardener's lad maybe, and I could feel
I were earning something and had a place o' my
own in the world. That's what mother would 'a
wished for me. 'Never mind how humble you are
if you're earning your bread honest-like,' I've oft
heard her say. Poor mother, she'd be glad to know
I was out o' that lot anyway," and Tim's imagination
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>pointed back to the gipsy caravan. "All, saving
Diana&mdash;what a lot they are, to be sure! I'm sure
and I hope she'll get out of it some day. 'Tis best
to hope anyway, so I'll try not to be down-hearted,"
and again Tim glanced up at the lovely sky. "If
I could but make a good guess now which of them
there stars is heaven, or the way into it anyway,
I'd seem to know better-like where poor mother is,
and I'd look for it every night. I'm going to try
to be a better lad, mother dear. I can promise you
that, and somehow I can't help thinking things 'll
come straighter for me."</p>

<p>And then Tim curled himself round like a dormouse,
and shut up his bright merry eyes, and in
five minutes was fast asleep.</p>

<p>He had kept awake later than he knew probably,
for the next morning's sun was higher in the skies
than he had intended it should be when a slight
shake of his arm and a not unfriendly though
rough voice awoke him. Up he jumped in a fright,
for he had not yet got over the fear of being pursued.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he cried, but Peter&mdash;for
Peter it was&mdash;soon reassured him.</p>

<p>"Naught's the matter," he said, "don't be afeared,
but we're close to Monkhaven. I've got to go on
to the wharf, but that's out o' your way. I thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>we'd best talk over like what you'd best do. I've
been up early; I want to get to the wharf before it's
crowded. So after you've had some breakfast, you
and the little uns, what d'ye think of next?"</p>

<p>"To find the quickest road to Sandle'ham," said
Tim; "that's the only place they can tell the name
of near their home. Diana," he went on, "Diana
thought as how I'd better go straight to the police
at Monkhaven and tell them the whole story, only
not so as to set them after Mick if I can help it.
She said the police here is sure to know of the
children's being stolen by now, and they'd put us
in the way of getting quick to their home."</p>

<p>"I think she's right," said Peter. "I'd go with
you myself, but my master's a sharp one, and I'd
get into trouble for leaving the boat and the horse,
even if he didn't mind my having took passengers
for onst," he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Tim, "I'll manage all right. Not
that I like going to the police, but if so be as it
can't be helped. And look here, Peter," he went
on, drawing out of the inside of his jacket a little
parcel carefully pinned to the lining, "talking of
passengers, this is all I can give you at present.
It was all Diana could get together, but I feel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>certain sure, as I told you, the old gentleman and
lady will do something handsome when they hear
how good you've been," and out of the little packet
he gradually, for the coins were enveloped in much
paper, produced a half-crown, three shillings, and
some coppers.</p>

<p>Peter eyed them without speaking. He was
fond of money, and even half-a-crown represented a
good deal to him. But he shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to take nothing of that," he said;
"you're not yet at your journey's end. I won't
say but what I'd take a something, and gladly, from
the old gentleman if he sees fit to send it when
he's heard all about it. A letter'll always get to
me, sooner or later, at the 'Bargeman's Rest,' Crookford.
You can remember that&mdash;Peter Toft&mdash;that's
my name."</p>

<p>"I'll not forget, you may be sure," said Tim.
"It's very good of you not to take any, for it's true,
as you say, we may need it. And so you think
too it's best to go straight to the police at Monkhaven."</p>

<p>"I do so," said Peter, and thus it was settled.</p>

<p>There were some tears, as might have been
expected, and not only on the children's part, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>they came to say good-bye to Mrs. Peter and the
baby. But they soon dried in the excitement of
getting on shore again and setting off under Tim's
care on the last stage of their journey "home."</p>

<p>"Is it a very long walk, do you think, Tim?"
they asked. "Us knows the way a <i>long</i> way down
the Sandle'ham road. Is that Sandle'ham?" as
they saw the roofs and chimneys of Monkhaven
before them.</p>

<p>"I wish it were!" said Tim. "No, that's a place
they call Monkhaven, but it's on the road to
Sandle'ham. Did you never hear tell of Monkhaven,
master and missy?&mdash;think now."</p>

<p>But after "thinking" for half a quarter of the
second, the two fair heads gave it up.</p>

<p>"No; us had never heard of Monkhaven. What
did it matter? Us would much rather go straight
home."</p>

<p>Then Tim had to enter upon an explanation.
He did not know the nearest way to Sandle'ham,
and they might wander about the country, losing their
way. They had very little money, and it most
likely was too far to walk. He was afraid to ask
unless sure it was of some one he could trust; for
Mick might have sent word to some one at Monk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>haven
about them. Then after Sandle'ham, which
way were they to go? There was but one thing to
do&mdash;ask the police. The police would take care of
them and set them on the way.</p>

<p>But oh, poor Tim! Little did he know the
effect of that fatal word, and yet he had far more
reason to dread the police than the twins could
have. More than once he had only just escaped
falling into its clutches, and all through his vagrant
life he had of course come to regard its officers as
his natural enemies. But he had put all that aside,
and, strong in his good cause, was ready now to turn
to them as the children's protectors. Duke and
Pamela, on the contrary, who had no real reason for
being afraid of the police, were in frantic terror;
their poor little imaginations set to work and
pictured "prison" as where they were sure to be
sent to. They would rather go back to the gipsies,
they would rather wander about the fields with
Tim till they died&mdash;rather <i>anything</i> than go near the
police. And they cried and sobbed and hung upon
Tim in their panic of terror, till the poor boy was
fairly at his wit's end, and had to give in so far as
to promise to say no more about it at present. So
they spent the early hours of the beautiful spring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>morning in a copse outside the little town, where
they were quite happy, and ate the provisions
Peter's wife had put up for them with a good
appetite, thinking no more of the future than the
birds in the bushes; while poor Tim was grudging
every moment of what he felt to be lost time, and
wondering where they were to get their next meal
or find shelter for the night!</p>

<p>It ended at last in a compromise. Tim received
gracious permission himself to go to the police to
ask the way, provided he left "us" in the wood&mdash;"us"
promising to be very good, not to stray out of
a certain distance, to speak to no possible passers-by,
and to hide among the brushwood if any suspicious-looking
people came near.</p>

<p>And, far more anxious at heart than if he could
have persuaded them to come with him, but still
with no real misgiving but that in half an hour he
would be back with full directions for the rest of
their journey, Tim set off at a run in quest of the
police office of Monkhaven. He was soon in the
main street of the town, which after all was more
like a big village&mdash;except at the end where lay
the canal wharf, which was dirty and crowded and
bustling&mdash;and had no difficulty in finding the house
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>he was in search of. On the walls outside were
pasted up posters of different sizes and importance&mdash;notices
of new regulations, and "rewards" for various
losses&mdash;but Tim, taking no notice of any of these,
hastened to knock at the door, and eagerly, though
not without some fear, stood waiting leave to enter.</p>

<p>Two or three policemen were standing or sitting
about talking to each other. Tim's first knock was
not heard, but a second brought one to the door.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," said the boy without waiting to be
asked what he wanted, "could you tell me the
nearest way to Sandle'ham? I'm on my way there&mdash;leastways
to some place near-by there&mdash;there's
two childer with me, sir, as has got strayed away
from their home, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that he's saying?" said another man
coming forward&mdash;he was the head officer evidently&mdash;"Tell
us that again,"&mdash;"Just make him come
inside, Simpkins, and just as well shut to the door,"
he added in a low voice. Tim came forward
unsuspiciously. "Well, what's that you were saying?"
he went on to Tim.</p>

<p>"It's two childer, sir," repeated Tim&mdash;"two small
childer as has got strayed away from their home&mdash;you
may have heard of it?&mdash;and I'm a-taking them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>back, only I'm not rightly sure of the way, and I
thought&mdash;I thought, as it was the best to ax you,
seeing as you've maybe heard&mdash;&mdash;" but here Tim's
voice, which had been faltering somewhat, so keen
and hard was the look directed upon him, came
altogether to an end; and he grew so red and
looked so uneasy that perhaps it was no wonder
if Superintendent Boyds thought him a suspicious
character.</p>

<p>"Ah indeed!&mdash;just so&mdash;you thought maybe we'd
heard something of some children as had <i>strayed</i>&mdash;<i>strayed</i>;
not been decoyed away&mdash;oh not at all&mdash;away
from their home. And of course, young man,
<i>you'd</i> heard nothing. You, nor those that sent you,
didn't know nothing of this here, I suppose?" and
Boyds unfolded a yellow paper lying on the table
and held it up before Tim's face. "This here is
new to you, no doubt?"</p>

<p>Tim shook his head. The yellow paper with big
black letters told him nothing. Even the big
figures, "&pound;20 Reward," standing alone at the top,
had no meaning for him. "I can't read, sir," he
said, growing redder than before.</p>

<p>"Oh indeed! and who was it then that told you
to come here about the children to ask the way, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>that you could take them home, you know, and get
the reward all nice and handy? You thought maybe
you'd get it straight away, and that we'd send
'em home for you&mdash;was that what father or mother
thought?"</p>

<p>Tim looked up, completely puzzled.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about a reward," he
said, "and I haven't no father or mother. Di&mdash;&mdash;"
but here he stopped short. "Diana told me to
come to you," he was going to have said, when it
suddenly struck him that the gipsy girl had bid
him beware of mentioning any names.</p>

<p>"Who?" said the superintendent sharply.</p>

<p>"I can't say," said Tim. "It was a friend o'
mine&mdash;that's all I can say&mdash;as told me to come
here."</p>

<p>"A friend, eh? I'm thinking we'll have to
know some more about some of your friends before
we're done with you. And where is these same
children, then? You can tell us that anyway!"</p>

<p>"No," said Tim, beginning to take fright, "I
can't. They'd be afeared&mdash;dreadful&mdash;if they saw
one o' your kind. I'll find my own way to
Sandle'ham if you can't tell it me," and he turned
to go.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>But the policeman called Simpkins, at a sign
from his superior, caught hold of him.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, young man, not so fast," said
Boyds. "You'll have to tell us where these there
children are afore you're off."</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;indeed I can't&mdash;they'd be so frightened,"
said Tim. "Let me go, and I'll try to get them to
come back here with me&mdash;oh do let me go!"</p>

<p>But Simpkins only held him the faster.</p>

<p>"Shut him up in there for a bit," said Boyds,
pointing to a small inner room opening into the one
where they were,&mdash;"shut him in there till he thinks
better of it," and Simpkins was preparing to do so
when Tim turned to make a last appeal. "Don't
lock me up whatever you do," he said, clasping his
hands in entreaty; "they'll die of fright if they're
left alone. I'd rather you'd go with me nor leave
them alone. Yes, I'll show you where they are if
you'll let me run on first so as they won't be so
frightened."</p>

<p>Simpkins glanced at Boyds&mdash;he was a kinder
man than the superintendent and really sharper,
though much less conceited. He was half inclined
to believe in Tim.</p>

<p>"What do you say to that?" he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>But Boyds shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's some trick in it. Let him run on
first&mdash;I daresay! The children's safe enough with
those as sent him here to find out. No, no; lock
him up, and I'll step round to Mr. Bartlemore's,"&mdash;Mr.
Bartlemore was the nearest magistrate,&mdash;"and
see what he thinks about it all. It'll not take me
long, and it'll show this young man here we're in
earnest. Lock him up."</p>

<p>Simpkins pushed Tim, though not roughly, into
the little room, and turned the key on him. The
boy no longer made any resistance or appeal. Mr.
Boyds put on his hat and went out, and the police
office returned to its former state of sleepy quiet so
far as appearances went. But behind the locked door
a poor ragged boy was sobbing his eyes out, twisting
and writhing himself about in real agony of mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, my master and missy, why did I leave you?
What will they be doing? Oh they was right
and I was wrong! The perlice is a bad, wicked,
unbelieving lot&mdash;oh my, oh my!&mdash;if onst I was
but out o' here&mdash;&mdash;" but he stopped suddenly.
The words he had said without thinking seemed to
say themselves over again to him as if some one
else had addressed them to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Out o' here," why shouldn't he get out of here?
And Tim looked round him curiously. There was
a small window and it was high up. There was no
furniture but the bench on which he was sitting.
But Tim was the son of a mason, and it was not for
nothing that he had lived with gipsies for so long.
He was a perfect cat at climbing, and as slippery
as an eel in the way he could squeeze himself
through places which you would have thought
scarcely wide enough for his arm. His sobs ceased,
his face lighted up again; he drew out of his pocket
his one dearest treasure, from which night or day
he was never separated, his pocket-knife, and, propping
the bench lengthways slanting against the wall
like a ladder, he managed to fix it pretty securely
by scooping out a little hollow in the roughly-boarded
floor, so as to catch the end of the bench and prevent
its slipping down. And just as Superintendent
Boyds was stepping into Squire Bartlemore's study
to wait for that gentleman's appearance, a pair of
bright eyes in a round sunburnt face might have
been seen spying the land from the small window
high up in the wall of the lock-up room of the
police office. Spying it to good purpose, as will
soon be seen, though in the meantime I think it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>will be well to return to Duke and Pamela all alone
in the copse.</p>

<p>Tim had not been gone five minutes before they
began to wonder when he would be back again.
They sat quite still, however, for perhaps a quarter
of an hour, for they were just a little frightened at
finding themselves really alone. If Tim had turned
back again I don't think he would have had much
difficulty in persuading them to go with him, even
to the dreadful police! But Tim never thought of
turning back; he had too thoroughly taken the
little people at their word.</p>

<p>After a while they grew so tired of waiting
quietly that they jumped up and began to run
about. Once or twice they were scared by the
sounds of footsteps or voices at a little distance, but
nobody came actually through the copse, and they
soon grew more assured, and left off speaking in
whispers and peeping timidly over their shoulders.
At last, "Sister," said Duke, "don't you think us
might go just a teeny weeny bit out of the wood,
to watch if us can't see Tim coming down the road?
I know which side he went."</p>

<p>"Us promised to stay here, didn't us?" replied
Pamela.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but us <i>would</i> be staying here," said Duke
insinuatingly. "It's just to peep, you know, to see
if Tim's coming. He'd be very glad, for p'raps he'll
not be quite sure where to find us again, and if us
goes a little way along the road he'd see us quicker,
and if us can't see him us can come back here
again."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Pamela, and, hand in hand, the
two made their way out of the shelter of the trees
and trotted half timidly a little way along the road.
It felt fresh and bright after the shady wood; some
way before them they saw rows of houses, and
already they had passed cottages standing separately
in their gardens and a little to the right was a church
with a high steeple. Had they gone straight on they
would soon have found themselves in Monkhaven
High Street, where, at this moment, Tim was shut
up in the police office. But after wandering on a
little way they got frightened, for no Tim was to be
seen, and they stood still and looked at each other.</p>

<p>"P'raps this isn't the way he went after all,"
said Pamela. They had already passed a road to
the left, which also led into the town, though less
directly.</p>

<p>"He <i>might</i> have gone that way," said Duke,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>pointing back to this other road; "let's go a little
way along there and look."</p>

<p>Pamela made no objection. The side road turned
out more attractive, for a little way from the corner
stood a pretty white house in a really lovely garden.
It reminded them of their own home, and they stood
at the gates peeping in, admiring the flower-beds
and the nicely-kept lawn and smooth gravel paths,
for the moment forgetting all about where they were
and what had become of their only protector.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, they were rudely brought
back to the present and to the fears of the morning,
for from where they were they caught sight of a
burly blue-coated figure making his way to the
front door from a side gate by which he had entered
the garden; for this pretty house was no other than
Squire Bartlemore's, and the tall figure was that of
Superintendent Boyds. He could not possibly have
seen them&mdash;they were very tiny, and the bushes as
well as the railings hid them from the view of any
one not quite close to the gates. But they saw <i>him</i>&mdash;that
was enough, and more than enough.</p>

<p>"He's caught Tim and put him in prison," said
Pamela, and in a terror-stricken whisper, "and now
he's coming for <i>us</i>, bruvver;" and bruvver, quite as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>frightened as she, did not attempt to reassure her.
Too terrified to see that the policeman was not
coming their way at all, but was quietly striding on
towards the house, they caught each other again by
the hand and turned to fly. And fly they did&mdash;one
could scarcely have believed such tiny creatures
could run so fast and so far. They did not look
which way they went&mdash;only that it was in the
other direction from whence they had come. They
ran and ran&mdash;then stopped to take breath and glance
timidly behind them, and without speaking ran on
again&mdash;till they had left quite half a mile between
them and the pretty garden, and ventured at last to
stand still and look about them. They were in a
narrow lane&mdash;high hedges shut it in at each side&mdash;they
could see very little way before or behind.
But though they listened anxiously, no sound but
the twittering of the birds in the trees, and the
faint murmur of a little brook on the other side of
hedge, was to be heard.</p>

<p>"He can't be running after us, I don't fink,"
said Pamela, drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>"No," said Duke, but then he looked round disconsolately.
"What can us do?" he said. "Tim
will never know to find us here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tim is in prison," said Pamela, "It's no use
us going back to meet him. I know he's in prison."</p>

<p>"Then what can us do?" repeated Duke.</p>

<p>"Us must go home and ask Grandpapa to get
poor Tim out of prison," said Pamela.</p>

<p>"But, sister, how can us go home? <i>I</i> don't
know the way, do you?"</p>

<p>Pamela looked about her doubtfully.</p>

<p>"P'raps it isn't so very far," she said. "Us had
better go on; and when it's a long way from the
policeman, us can ask somebody the road."</p>

<p>There seemed indeed nothing else to do. On
they tramped for what seemed to them an endless
way, and still they were in the narrow lane with the
high hedges; so that, after walking for a very long
time, they could have fancied they were in the
same place where they started. And as they met
no one they could not ask the way, even had they
dared to do so. At last&mdash;just as they were beginning
to get very tired&mdash;the lane quite suddenly came
out on a short open bit of waste land, across which
a cart-track led to a wide well-kept road. And
this, though they had no idea of it, was actually the
coach-road to Sandlingham; for&mdash;though, it must be
allowed, more by luck than good management&mdash;they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>had hit upon a short cut to the highway, which if
Tim had known of it would have saved him all his
present troubles!</p>

<p>For a moment or two Duke and Pamela felt
cheered by having at last got out of the weary lane.
They ran eagerly across the short distance that
separated them from the road, with a vague idea
that once on it they would somehow or other see
something&mdash;meet some one to guide them as to what
next to do. But it was not so&mdash;there it stretched
before them, white and smooth and dusty at both
sides, rising a little to the right and sloping downwards
to the left&mdash;away, away, away&mdash;to where?
Not a cart or carriage of any kind&mdash;not a foot-passenger
even&mdash;was to be seen. And the sun was
hot, and the four little legs were very tired; and
where was the use of tiring them still more when
they might only be wandering farther and farther
from their home? For, though the choice was not
great, being simply a question of up-hill or down-dale,
it was as bad as if there had been half a dozen
ways before them, as they had not the least idea
which of the two was the right one!</p>

<p>The two pair of blue eyes looked at each other
piteously; then the eyelids drooped, and big tears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>slowly welled out from underneath them; the twins
flung their arms about each other, and, sitting down
on the little bit of dusty grass that bordered the
highway, burst into loud and despairing sobs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>By slow degrees their sobs exhausted themselves.
Pamela leant her head against Duke and shut her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I am so tired, bruvver," she said. "If us could
only get some quiet place out of the sun I would
like to lie down and go to sleep. Wouldn't you,
bruvver?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Duke.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the birds would cover us up wif
leaves," said Pamela dreamily, "like those little
children long ago?"</p>

<p>"That would be if us was dead," said Duke.
"Oh sister, you don't think us must be going to die!"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Pamela in her turn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Duke raised himself a little, and
Pamela, feeling him move, sat up and opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, but he did not need
to answer, for just then she too heard the sound
that had caught Duke's ears. It was the barking
of a dog&mdash;not a deep baying sound, but a short,
eager, energetic bark, and seemingly very near them.
The children looked at each other and then rose to
their feet.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you fink it was Toby?" said Pamela
in a low voice, though why she spoke so low she
could not have said.</p>

<p>Duke nodded, and then, moved by the same
impulse, they went forward to the middle of the
road and looked about them, hand in hand. Again
came the sharp eager bark, and this time a voice
was heard as if soothing the dog, though they could
not quite catch the words. But some one was near
them&mdash;thus much seemed certain, and the very idea
had comfort in it. Still, for a minute or two they
could not make out where were the dog and its
owner; for they did not know that a short way
down the road a path ending in a stile crossed the
fields from the village of Nooks to the high-road.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
And when, therefore, at but a few paces distant,
there suddenly appeared a small figure, looking
dark against the white dust of the road, frisking
and frolicking about in evident excitement, it really
seemed to the little brother and sister as if it had
sprung out of the earth by magic. They had not
time, however, to speak&mdash;hardly to wonder&mdash;to
themselves before, all frisking and frolicking at an
end, the shaggy ball was upon them, and, with a
rush that for half a second made Pamela inclined to
scream, the little dog flew at them, barking, yelping,
almost choking with delight, flinging himself
first on one then on the other, darting back a step
or two as if to see them more distinctly and make
sure he was not mistaken, then rolling himself upon
them again all quivering and shaking with rapture.
And the cry of ecstasy that broke from the twins
would have gone to the heart of any one that loved
them.</p>

<p>"Oh Toby, Toby!&mdash;bruvver&mdash;sister&mdash;it is, it <i>is</i>
our own Toby. He has come to take us home. Oh
dear, <i>dear</i> Toby!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="seven" id="seven"></a><img src="./images/007.jpg" alt="OH TOBY, TOBY!&mdash;BRUVVER&mdash;SISTER&mdash;IT IS, IT IS OUR OWN TOBY" title="OH TOBY, TOBY!&mdash;BRUVVER&mdash;SISTER&mdash;IT IS, IT IS OUR OWN TOBY" /></div>

<div class='center'><small>"OH TOBY, TOBY!&mdash;BRUVVER&mdash;SISTER&mdash;IT IS, IT IS OUR OWN TOBY, HE HAS<br />
COME TO TAKE US HOME. OH DEAR, DEAR TOBY!"</small>&mdash;p. <a href='#Page_220'>220</a>.</div>

<p>It <i>did</i> go to the heart of some one not far off.
A quaintly-clad, somewhat aged, woman was slowly
climbing the stile at the moment that the words
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>rang clearly out into the summer air. "Oh Toby,
<i>our</i> Toby!" and no one who had not seen it could
have believed how nimbly old Barbara skipped or
slid or tumbled down the steps on the road-side of
the stile, and how, in far less time than it takes to tell
it, she was down on her knees in the dust with a
child in each arm, and Toby flashing about the trio,
so that he seemed to be everywhere at once.</p>

<p>"My precious darlings!&mdash;my dear little master
and missy!&mdash;and has old Barbara found you after
all? or Toby rather. I thank the Lord who has
heard my prayers. To think I should have such a
delight in my old days as to be the one to take you
back to my dearest lady! A sore heart was I
coming along with&mdash;to think that I had heard
nothing of you for all I had felt so sure I would.
And oh, my darlings, where <i>have</i> you been, and how
has it all come about?"</p>

<p>But a string of questions was the first answer
she got.</p>

<p>"Have you come to look for us, dear Barbara?
Did Grandpapa and Grandmamma send you, and
Toby too? How did you know which way to come?
And have you seen Tim? Did Tim tell you?"</p>

<p>"Tim, Tim, I know nought of who Tim is, my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>dearies," said Barbara, shaking her head. "If it's
any one that's been good to you, so much the better.
I've been at Nooks, the village hard by, for some
days with my niece. I meant to have stayed but
two or three nights, but I've been more nor a
week, and a worry in my heart all the time not to
get back home to hear if there was no news of you,
and how my poor lady was. And to think if I <i>had</i>
gone home I wouldn't have met you&mdash;dear&mdash;dear&mdash;but
the ordering of things is wonderful!"</p>

<p>"And didn't you come to look for us, then?
But why is Toby with you?" asked the children.</p>

<p>"He was worritting your dear Grandmamma.
There was no peace with him after you were lost.
And though I didn't rightly come to Monkhaven
to look for you, I had a feeling&mdash;it was bore in on
me that I'd maybe find some trace of you, and I
thought Toby would be the best help. And truly
I could believe he'd scented you were not far off&mdash;the
worry he's been all this morning! A-barking
and a-sniffing and a-listening like! I was in two
minds as to which way I'd take this morning&mdash;round
by Monkhaven or by the lane. But Toby he
was all for the lane, and so I just took his way, the
Lord be thanked!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"He <i>knowed</i> us was here&mdash;he did, didn't he?
Oh, darling Toby!" cried the twins.</p>

<p>But then Barbara had to be told all. Not very
clear was the children's account of their adventures
at first; for the losing of Tim and the vision of the
policeman and the canal boat were the topmost on
their minds, and came tumbling out long before anything
about the gipsies, which of course was the
principal thing to tell. Bit by bit, however, thanks
to her patience, their old friend came to understand
the whole. She heaved a deep sigh at last.</p>

<p>"To think that it was the gipsies after all."</p>

<p>But she made not many remarks, and said little
about the broken-bowl-part of the story. It would
be for their dear Grandmamma to show them where
they had been wrong, she thought modestly, if
indeed they had not found it out for themselves
already. I think they had.</p>

<p>"Us is always going to tell Grandmamma <i>everyfing</i>
now," said Pamela.</p>

<p>"And us is always going to listen to the talking
of that little voice," added Duke.</p>

<p>But the first excitement over, old Barbara began to
notice that the children were looking very white and
tired. How was she ever to get them to Brigslade&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>a
five miles' walk at least&mdash;where again, for she had
chosen Brigslade market-day on purpose, she counted
on Farmer Carson to give her a lift home? She was
not strong enough to carry them&mdash;one at a time&mdash;more
than a short distance. Besides she had her
big basket. Glancing at it gave her another idea.</p>

<p>"I can at least give you something to eat," she
said. "Niece Turwall packed all manner of good
things in here," and, after some rummaging, out she
brought two slices of home-made cake and a bottle
of currant wine, of which she gave them each a
little in a cup without a handle which Mrs. Turwall
had thoughtfully put in. The cake and the wine
revived the children wonderfully. They said they
were able to walk "a long long way," and indeed
there was nothing for it but to try, and so the happy
little party set off.</p>

<p>The thought of Tim, however, weighed on their
minds, and when Barbara had arrived at some sort
of idea as to who he was, and what he had done,
she too felt even more anxious about him. Even
without prejudice it must be allowed that the police
of those days were not what they are now, and
Barbara knew that for a poor waif like Tim it
would not be easy to obtain a fair hearing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he won't be wanting to get that gipsy
girl into trouble by telling on the lot of them, which
will make it harder for the poor lad," thought the
shrewd old woman, for the children had told her all
about Diana. "But there's nothing to be done that
I can see except to get the General to write to the
police at Monkhaven." For Mrs. Twiss knew that
Duke and Pam would be terribly against the idea
of going back to the town and to the police office.
And she herself had no wish to do so&mdash;she was not
without some distrust of the officers of the law herself,
and it would, too, have grieved her sadly not
to have been the one to restore the lost children
to their friends. Besides, Farmer Carson would be
waiting for her at the cross roads, for "if by any
chance I don't come back before, you may be sure
I'll be there on Friday, next market-day," she had
said to him at parting.</p>

<p>"You don't think they'll put Tim in prison, do
you?" asked Duke, seeing that the old woman's
face grew grave when she had heard all.</p>

<p>"Oh no, surely, not so bad as that," she replied.
"And even if we went back I don't know that it
would do much good."</p>

<p>"Go back to where the policemans are," ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>claimed
the twins, growing pale at the very idea.
"Oh please&mdash;<i>please</i> don't," and they both crept closer
to their old friend.</p>

<p>"But if it would make them let Tim come wif us?"
added Pamela, shivering, nevertheless. "I'd <i>try</i> not
to be frightened. Poor Tim&mdash;he has been so good
to us, us can't go and leave him all alone."</p>

<p>"But, my deary," said Barbara, "I don't rightly
see what we can do for him. The police might
think it right to keep us all there too&mdash;and I'm
that eager to get you home to ease your dear
Grandmamma and the General. I think it's best
to go on and get your Grandpapa to write about
the poor boy."</p>

<p>But now the idea of rescuing Tim was in the
children's heads it was not so easy to get rid of it.
They stood still looking at each other and at Mrs.
Twiss with tears in their eyes; they had come by
this time perhaps half a mile from where they had
met their friends. The high-road was here shadier
and less dusty, and it was anything but inviting to
think of retracing the long stretch to Monkhaven,
though from where they stood, a turn in the road
hid it from them. All at once a whistle caught
their ears&mdash;a whistle two or three times repeated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>in a particular way&mdash;Toby pricked up his ears, put
himself in a very valiant attitude, and barked with
a great show of importance, as much as to say, "Just
you look out now, whoever you are. <i>I</i> am on guard
now." But his bark did not seem to strike awe
into the whistler, whoever he was. Again his note
sounded clear and cheery. And this time, with a
cry of "It's Tim, it's Tim," off flew Duke and Pam
down the road, followed by Barbara&mdash;Toby of course
keeping up a running accompaniment of flying circles
round the whole party till at last the sight of his
beloved little master and mistress hugging and kissing
a bright-eyed, clean-faced, but sadly ragged boy
was altogether too much for his refined feelings, and
he began barking with real fury, flinging himself
upon Tim as if he really meant to bite him.</p>

<p>Duke caught him up.</p>

<p>"Silly Toby," he cried, "it's Tim. You must
learn to know Tim;" and old Barbara coming up by
this time and speaking to the boy in a friendly
tone, poor Toby's misgivings were satisfied, and he
set to work to wagging his tail in a slightly subdued
manner.</p>

<p>Then came explanations on both sides. Tim
had to tell how he had slipped himself out through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>the window, narrow as it was, and how, thanks to an
old water-butt and some loose bricks in the wall, he
had scrambled down like a cat, and made off as fast
as his legs would carry him to the place where he
had left the children.</p>

<p>"And when you wasn't there I was fairly beat&mdash;I
was," he said. "I knowed they hadn't had time
to find you&mdash;perlice I mean&mdash;but I saw as you
must have got tired waiting so long. So off I set
till I met a woman who told me the way to the
Sandle'ham road. I had a fancy you'd ask for it
rather than come into the town if you thought
they'd cotched me, and I was about right you see."</p>

<p>"Is this the Sandle'ham road? Oh yes, Barbara
told us it was," said the children. "But us didn't
know it was. Us just runned and runned when us
saw the policeman, us was so frightened."</p>

<p>"But us <i>was</i> going back to try to get you out
of prison if Barbara would have let us," added
Pamela.</p>

<p>Then all about Barbara and Toby had to be
explained, and a great weight fell from Tim's heart
when he quite understood that the old woman was
a real home friend&mdash;that there would no longer be
any puzzle or difficulty as to how to do or which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>way to go, now that they had fallen in with this
trusty protector.</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;well now this <i>are</i> a piece of luck,
and no mistake," he repeated, one big smile lighting
up all his pleasant face. But suddenly it clouded
over.</p>

<p>"Then, ma'am, if you please, would it be better
for me not to come no further? Would I be in
the way, maybe?"</p>

<p>The children set up a cry before Barbara had
time to reply.</p>

<p>"No, no, Tim; you <i>must</i> come. Grandpapa and
Grandmamma will always take care of Tim, 'cos
he's been so good to us&mdash;won't they, Barbara?"</p>

<p>Barbara looked rather anxious. Her own heart
had warmed to the orphan boy, but she did not
know how far she was justified in making promises
for other people.</p>

<p>"I dursn't go back to Monkhaven," said Tim;
"they'd be sure to cotch me, and they'd give it me
for a-climbing out o' window and a-running away.
Nor I dursn't go back to Mick. But you've only
to say the word, ma'am, and I'm off. I'll hide about,
and mayhap somehow I might get a chance among
the boat-people. It's all I can think of; for I've
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>no money&mdash;leastways this is master's and missy's,
and you'd best take it for them," he went on, as he
pulled out the little packet from the inside of his
jacket which he had already vainly offered to Peter.
"And about Peter, p'raps you'd say a word to the
old gentleman about sending him something. He
were very good to us, he were; and he can always
get a letter that's sent to&mdash;&mdash;" but here the lump
that had kept rising in the poor boy's throat all the
time he was speaking, and that he had gone on
choking down, got altogether too big; he suddenly
broke off and burst out sobbing. It was too much&mdash;not
only to have to leave the dear little master
and missy, but to have to say good-bye to all his
beautiful plans and hopes&mdash;of learning to be a good
and respectable boy&mdash;of leading a settled and decent
life such as mother&mdash;"poor mother"&mdash;could look
down upon with pleasure from her home up there
somewhere near the sun, in the heaven about which
her child knew so little, but in which he still
most fervently believed.</p>

<p>"I'm a great fool," he sobbed, "but I did&mdash;I
did want to be a good lad, and to give up gipsying."</p>

<p>Barbara's heart by this time was completely
melted, and Duke's and Pam's tears were flowing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tim, dear Tim, you must come with us," they
said. "Oh, Barbara, do tell him he's to come.
Why, even Toby sees how good Tim is; he's not
barking a bit, and he's sniffing at him to show he's
a friend."</p>

<p>And Toby, hearing his own name, looked up in
the old woman's face as if he too were pleading
poor Tim's cause. She hesitated no longer.</p>

<p>"Come with us my poor boy," she said, "it'll
go hard if we can't find a place for you somewheres.
And the General and the old lady is good and kind
as can be. Don't ye be a-feared, but come with us.
You must help me to get master and missy home,
for it's a good bit we have to get over, you know."</p>

<p>So Tim dried his eyes, and his hopes revived.
And this time the little cavalcade set out in good
earnest to make the best of their way to Brigslade,
with no lookings back towards Monkhaven; for,
indeed, their greatest wish was to leave it as quickly
as possible far behind them. They were a good
way off fortunately before clever Superintendent
Boyds and his assistants found out that their bird
was flown, and when they did find it out they went
after him in the wrong direction; and it was not
till three days after the children had been safe at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>home that formal information, which doubtless
<i>would</i> have been very cheering to poor Grandpapa,
came to him that the police at Monkhaven were
believed to be on the track!</p>

<p>How can I describe to you that coming home?
If I could take you back with me some thirty years
or so and let you hear it as I did then&mdash;direct from
the lips of a very old lady and gentleman, who still
spoke to each other as "brother" and "sister,"
whose white hair was of the soft silvery kind which
one sees at a glance was <i>once</i> flaxen&mdash;oh how
much more interesting it would be, and how much
better it would be told! But that cannot be. My
dear old friends long ago told the story of their
childish adventure for the last time; though I am
very sure nothing would please them better than to
know it had helped to amuse for an hour or two
some of the Marmadukes and Pamelas of to-day.
So I will do my best.</p>

<p>It was a long stretch for the little legs to Brigslade;
without Tim I doubt if poor old Mrs. Twiss
and Toby would have got them there. But the boy
was not to be tired; his strength seemed "like the
strength of ten" Tims, thanks to the happy hopes
with which his heart was filled. He carried Pamela
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>and even Duke turn about on his back, he told
stories and sang songs to make them forget their
aching legs and smarting feet. And fortunately
there still remained enough home-made cake and
currant wine for every one to have a little refreshment,
especially as Tim found a beautifully clear
spring of water to mix with the wine when the
children complained of thirst.</p>

<p>They got to the cross-roads before Farmer
Carson, for Barbara was one of those sensible people
who always take time by the forelock; so they
rested there till the old gray mare came jogging up,
and her master, on the look-out for one old woman,
but not for a party of four&mdash;five I should say,
counting Toby&mdash;could not believe his eyes, and
scarcely his ears, when Mrs. Twiss told him the
whole story. How they all got into the spring-cart
I couldn't explain, but they did somehow, and the
mare did not seem to mind it at all. And at last,
late on that lovely early summer evening, Farmer
Carson drew up in the lane at the back of the house;
and, after helping the whole party out, drove off with
a hearty Good-night, and hopes that they'd find the
old gentleman and lady in good health, and able to
bear the happy surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be broken gently to them; and how to
do this had been on Barbara's mind all the time
they had been in the cart, for up till then she had
been able to think of nothing but how to get the
children along. They, of course&mdash;except perhaps
that they were too tired for any more excitement&mdash;would
have been for running straight in with joyful
cries. But they were so subdued by fatigue that
their old friend found no difficulty in persuading
them to sit down quietly by the hedge, guarded by
Tim, while she and Toby went in to prepare the way.</p>

<p>"For you know, my dearies, your poor Grandmamma
has not been well and the start might be
bad for her," she explained.</p>

<p>"But you're sure Grandmamma isn't <i>dead</i>?" said
poor Pamela, looking up piteously in Barbara's face.
"Duke was afraid she might be if us didn't come
soon."</p>

<p>"But now you <i>have</i> come she'll soon get well
again, please God," said Barbara, though her own
heart beat tremulously as she made her way round
by the back entrance.</p>

<p>It was Toby after all who "broke" the happy
tidings. In spite of all Barbara could do&mdash;of all her
"Hush, Toby, then,"'s "Gently my little doggie,"'s&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>he
<i>would</i> rush in to the parlour as soon as the door
was opened in such a rapture of joyful barking, tail
wagging and rushing and dashing, that Grandmamma
looked up from the knitting she was trying to fancy
she was doing in her arm-chair by the fire, and
Grandpapa put down his five days' old newspaper
which he was reading by the window, with a curious
flutter of sudden hope all through them, notwithstanding
their many disappointments.</p>

<p>"It is you, Barbara, back again at last," began
Grandmamma. "How white you look, my poor
Barbara&mdash;and&mdash;why, what's the matter with Toby?
Is he so pleased to see us old people again?"</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> very pleased, ma'am&mdash;he's a very wise
and a very good feeling dog is Toby, there's no
doubt. And one that knows when to be sad and&mdash;and
when to be rejoiced, as I might say," said
Barbara, though her voice trembled with the effort
to speak calmly.</p>

<p>Something seemed to flash across the room to
Grandmamma as Mrs. Twiss spoke&mdash;down fell the
knitting, the needles, and the wool, all in a tangle,
as the old lady started to her feet.</p>

<p>"Barbara&mdash;Barbara Twiss!" she cried. "What
do you mean? Oh Barbara, you have news of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>darlings? Marmaduke, my dear husband, do you
hear?" and she raised her voice, "she has brought
us news at last," and Grandmamma tottered forward
a few steps and then, growing suddenly dazed and
giddy, would have fallen had not Grandpapa and
Barbara started towards her from different sides
and caught her. But she soon recovered herself,
and eagerly signed to Barbara to "tell." How
Barbara told she never knew. It seemed to her
that Grandmamma guessed the words before she spoke
them, and looking back on it all afterwards she could
recollect nothing but a sort of joyous confusion&mdash;Grandpapa
rushing out without his hat, but stopping
to take his stick all the same&mdash;Grandmamma holding
by the table to steady herself when, in another
moment, they were all back again&mdash;then a cluster
all together&mdash;of Grandpapa, Grandmamma, Duke,
Pamela and Barbara, with Nurse and Biddy, and
Dymock and Cook, and stable-boys and gardeners,
and everybody, and Toby everywhere at once.
Broken words and sobs and kisses and tears and
blessings all together, and Pamela's little soft high
voice sounding above all as she cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Grandmamma, us <i>is</i> so glad you are
not dead. Duke was so afraid you might be."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>And Tim&mdash;where was he?&mdash;standing outside in
the porch, but smiling to himself&mdash;not afraid of
being forgotten, for he had a trustful nature.</p>

<p>"It's easy to see as the old gentleman and lady
is terrible fond of master and missy," he thought.
"But they must be terrible clever folk in these
parts to have writing outside of the house even,"
for his glance had fallen on the quaintly-carved
letters on the lintel, "Niks sonder Arbitt." "I
wonder now what that there writing says," he
reflected.</p>

<p>But he was not allowed to wonder long. A few
moments more and there came the summons his
faithful little heart had been sure would come.</p>

<p>"Tim, Tim&mdash;where is Tim? Come and see our
Grandpapa and our Grandmamma, Tim," and two
pairs of little hot hands dragged him into the
parlour.</p>

<p>It was not at all like his dream, but it was far
grander than any room he had ever been in before,
and never afterwards did the boy forget the strange
sweet perfume which seemed a part of it all&mdash;the
scent of the dried rose-leaves in the jars, though he
did not then know what it was. But it always
came back to him when he thought of that first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>evening&mdash;the beginning to him of a good and honest
and useful life&mdash;when the tall old gentleman and
the sweet little old lady laid their hands on his
curly head and blessed him for what he had done
and promised to be his friends.</p>

<p>They kept their promise well and wisely.
Grandpapa took real trouble to find out what the
boy was best fitted for, and when he found it was
for gardening, Tim was thoroughly trained by old
Noble till he was able to get a good place of his
own. He lived with Barbara in her neat little
cottage, and in the evenings learned to read and
write and cipher, so that before very long he could
make out the letters in the porch, though Grandpapa
had to be asked to tell their meaning.</p>

<p>"Nothing without work," was what they meant.
They had been carved there by the old Dutchman
who had built the farmhouse, afterwards turned into
the pretty quaint "Arbitt Lodge."</p>

<p>"A good and true saying," added Grandpapa,
and so the three children to whom he was speaking
found it. For all three in their different ways
worked hard and well, and when in my childhood
I knew them as old people, I felt, even before I
quite understood it, that "the Colonel," as he then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>had become, and his sweet white-haired sister
deserved the love and respect they seemed everywhere
to receive. And I could see that it was
no common tie which bound to them their faithful
servant Timothy, whose roses were the pride of all
the country-side, when, after many years of separation,
he came to end his life in their service, after Duke's
"fighting days" were over and his widowed
sister was, but for him, alone in the world.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One question may be asked. Did they ever
hear of Diana again? Yes, though not till Tim
had grown into a strapping young fellow, and the
twins were tall and thin, and had long since left off
talking of "us."</p>

<p>There came along the lanes one summer's day a
covered van hung over at the back with baskets,
such as the children well remembered. A good-humoured
looking man was walking by the horse, a
handsome woman was sitting by the door plaiting
straw.</p>

<p>"Gipsies," cried the children, who were on their
way to the village, and, big as they were, they were
a little frightened when, with a cry, the woman
jumped down and flew towards them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Master and missy, don't you know me? I'm
Diana!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>And Diana it was, though very much changed
for the better. She had married one of her own
tribe, but a very good specimen, and the husband
and wife travelled about on their own account
making their living "honestly," as she took care to
tell. "For there's good and there's bad of us,
and it's been my luck to get a good one. Thank
God for it," she added, "for I've never forgot master
and missy's pretty telling me even poor Diana
might think God cared for her."</p>

<p>She was taken to see Grandpapa and Grandmamma
of course, and they would have helped her
and her husband to a settled life had they wished
it. But no&mdash;gipsies they were, and gipsies they
must remain. "It'd choke me to live inside four
walls," said Diana, "and we must travel about so as
we can see our own folk from time to time. But
whenever we pass this way we'll come to see master
and missy and Tim."</p>

<p>And so they did.</p>

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
